I think in practise this isn't going to work. Consider the case that
Brian cares about: "we do need to be as precise as possible with the
duty:period ratio". So if we want 1/5 duty we might request:

	.duty_cycle =3D 100, .period =3D 500

an are using pwm_set_state_exact(). Now consider this fails. What is the
next value you should try? It's hard to say without knowing why it
failed. If however you could do

	mystate.duty_cycle =3D 100
	mystate.period =3D 500
	pwm_round_state(pwm, &mystate);

and after that we have:

	mystate.duty_cycle =3D 99;
	mystate.period =3D 498;

(because pwm_round_state is supposed to round down[1] and the hardware can
implement multiples of 3 only). Then it is easier to determine the next
state to try.

[1] this isn't fixed yet, but I think it's sensible.
