Many SoC vendors use SoC-specific compatible string, often in addition to more 
generic ones. When a more generic compatible string is available, drivers can 
match against it, which avoid having to update drivers every time a new SoC 
integrates the same version of the IP core. The SoC-specific compatible string 
is still specified in DT, "just in case" we later realize that the IP core 
integrated in the SoC is slightly different than the other ones and requires 
specific handling in the driver.

I'm not completely happy with that scheme, as it's really a workaround for 
defective communication with the hardware team (or possibly defective hardware 
development...), but that's the best compromise we have so far.
