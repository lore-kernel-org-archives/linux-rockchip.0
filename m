It actually relates to tuning. If failing to sample data or cmd-resp,
the controller generate timeout interrupt in principle rather than
explicit CRC ones. So it makes sense for them to return -EIO instead of
-EILSEQ as it's hard for the driver to understand what was happening,
crc? device is broken? ...

It's no so clear to this retune design as if the driver already knows
it's a CRC, it will generate -EILSEQ and let core do tuning again, so
it means they don't need to call mmc_return_needed in their drivers.
Unless let drivers return CRC in any cases of CRC or timeout, but that
may make core do tuning more frequently even if not relating to tuning
which seems a little painful.

So it looks quite vague to me.:)
