In my book it is ok to do such a change. The driver continues to compile
just fine, it isn't knowingly broken. And if someone finds a regression
we can fix it then and have someone who cares for testing.

And even if a regulator changes its behaviour slightly and breaks in a
hardly detectable way, I would bet that in 95% of the cases it only
worked by chance before. And I hope for the remaining 5% who seem to
care about correctness, that the reverify on a kernel upgrade.

Yes, there might be some cases falling through the cracks, but if we
start to demand this kind of care from people who work on generic code
(here: PWM core) we will be stuck for a long time and scare people with
motivation away. So the lesser evil in my eyes is to accept that not all
corner cases might be handled because they are unknown.

Uwe
