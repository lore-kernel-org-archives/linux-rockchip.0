Hi Mark, I have a question for the one CPU DAI + multiple CODECs
setup. The machine driver defines 3 DAI links, connecting the same CPU
DAI to 3 different CODEC DAIs. Does ASoC/DAPM support
enabling/disabling an individual DAI link based on the status of the
endpoint widget (e.g. DAPM_SPK) connected to the corresponding CODEC?

The goal is to let user select either headphone(da7219) or
speaker(max98357a) as output. max98357a driver does not expose a
kcontrol for mute. It sets a shutdown GPIO on PCM_TRIGGER_START/STOP.
And it seems soc_pcm_trigger calls the trigger op of all 3 CODEC DAIs,
even when the DAPM_SPK widget is disabled by its pin switch.
