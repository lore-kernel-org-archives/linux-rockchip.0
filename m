yep, sounds good, especially as with your patch 9/9 you already declare these 
necessary timers.

simply ignore that case :-)

I.e. newer kernels are supposed to be able to run old devicetrees and in that 
case they will have the global-timer as (slightly unstable) clocksource.

Also on the cortex-a9 we also still have the smp-twd as clockevent device.
