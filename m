eMMC boot partitions are called mmcblkXbootY, and unless you have more
than one eMMC device on the system, they can be found either by looking
for /dev/mmcblk*boot* or by querying udev.  The advantage of using udev
is you can discover the physical device behind it by looking at DEVPATH,
ID_PATH, etc, but you may not have that installed on an embedded device.

However, as I say, just looking for /dev/mmcblk*boot* is sufficient to
find the eMMC boot partitions where there is just one eMMC device
present (which seems to be the standard setup.)

The mmc device numbering was tied to the mmc host numbering a while back
and the order that the hosts are probed should be completely independent
of whether a card is inserted or not:

        snprintf(md->disk->disk_name, sizeof(md->disk->disk_name),
                 "mmcblk%u%s", card->host->index, subname ? subname : "");

        snprintf(rpmb_name, sizeof(rpmb_name),
                 "mmcblk%u%s", card->host->index, subname ? subname : "");

I suspect that Mans is quoting something from the dim and distant past
to confuse the issue - as shown above, it is now dependent on the host
numbering order not the order in which cards are inserted.
