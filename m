No, because we don't use the builtin card detect on veyron.  ;)

We use GPIO card detect because we didn't like the way JTAG and SD
interacted.  Also on rk3288 the builtin card detect line had the wrong
voltage domain (you couldn't detect a card when the IO lines were
powered off).  The builtin card detect line is always driven low on
veyron.


I'm nearly certain that the root cause of my HLE errors is actually
related to the same problem addressed by the commit 7c5209c315ea
("mmc: core: Increase delay for voltage to stabilize from 3.3V to
1.8V").  I think that on minnie we're still on the hairy edge and
sometimes the line doesn't transition fast enough.

It appears that increasing this to 30ms avoids the HLE errors.

I _think_ I can actually fully fix this properly by temporarily
engaging the internal pull-ups while the voltage switch is happening.
This will bleed away the voltage just a little bit faster (since lines
are driven low here).  I'll try to confirm that.


In any case, it seems like we should take this patch since (without
this patch) the failure case when you get HLE errors is that the
interrupt controller fires over and over again (with no printouts) and
your system stalls with no error messages.
