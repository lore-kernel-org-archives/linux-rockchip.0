Yes, the rockchip_usb2phy_otg_sm_work() in the USB2 PHY driver and 
EHCI/OHCI platform
driver via the PHY framework can both do phy power on/off.  We do that 
because we want
to reduce USB2 PHY consumption in system runtime and deep sleep.

For EHCI/OHCI platform drivers, they call phy_power_on() in probe to 
power on USB2 PHY,
and don't power off USB2 PHY in system runtime, even if there's no USB2 
device connected.
They just call phy_power_off() in PM suspend, and call phy_power_on() in 
PM resume to
power on USB2 PHY again. AKA the EHCI/OHCI platform driver can only 
support USB power
management in deep sleep.

So we add a work in USB2 PHY driver to manage USB2 PHY power. The work 
scheduled every
60 seconds, check the USB D+/D- and disconnect status in GRF registers 
to know if any USB
device connected. If no USB connected,  it will call 
rockchip_usb2phy_power_off() to power
off USB2 PHY. And also, the USB2 PHY driver use an irq to detect D+/D- 
voltage when USB
device connected， and then call rockchip_usb2phy_power_on()  to power on 
USB2 PHY.
AKA the work is used to support USB PHY power management in runtime.

With this patch, the GRF USB commonon will always enable in system 
runtime. But we still
can set USB2 PHY enter suspend mode by power down most of PHY logic 
module via GRF,
so the phy-autosuspend is still useful.
On the other hand, commonon bit is used for PLL clock logical, its power 
consumption is
not big in theory,  I remember that I tested on the other SoC， the 
commonon bit consumed
about 1~2mA.

I'm not clear understand the race mentioned here.
IMO,  PHY framework power_off() and work rockchip_usb2phy_power_off() 
don't have race
problem.

And maybe there is a race between PHY framework power_off() and the 
delayed work
rockchip_usb2phy_power_on()  in USB2 PHY driver, but I think the 
probability is low，
the race case maybe：
1. EHCI/OHCI platform call  phy_power_off() in PM suspend;
2. Plug in an USB device after USB2 PHY has entered suspend;
3. Power on USB2 PHY again in work;
4. After these, finally the USB2 PHY is power on when system enter sleep.
