That'd work, even if it's a little awkward. That's basically one of my
suggestions below.

No, I guess we don't really need to unmap it. I just meant, you could
map/unmap every time you use it, or make sure you just map it once (and
only once).

Also (if it helps), you could use devm_ioremap(), in case you ever do
make it removable.
