This needs a rewording please. See below for hw-description vs. driver, so
the description should be centered around why this is a property of the hw
[like faulty controller implementation or whatever]

Devicetree is always about describing the hardware capabilites and never
about the actual nitty-gritty of driver implementation, aka it is not meant
as a space for hardware-independent config-settings or such.

As for only tegra evaluating this, is probably because it is still so new, like
january 2019 and Rob explicitly suggested it becoming common [0], which
suggests that the disable-cqe-dcmds should probably also be common.
