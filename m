The rk3399-gru-kevin is correct.

The rk3399-nanopc-t4 is not correct because the cpu and the gpu are
sharing the same cooling device (the fan). There are different
configurations:

1. The cpu cooling device for the CPU and the fan for the GPU

2. Different trip points on the CPU thermal zone, eg. one to for the CPU
cooling device and another one for the fan.

There are some variant for the above. If this board is not on battery,
you may want to give priority to the throughput, so activate the fan
first and then cool down the CPU. Or if you are on battery, you may want
to invert the trip points.

In any case, it is not possible to share the same cooling device for
different thermal zones.
