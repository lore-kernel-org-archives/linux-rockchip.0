For one, the kernelci board uses the uboot SPL not rkloader as 1st stage.
But I also think the real culprit might be the unconfigured cpu_b_sleep_h
gpio. 

So far I haven't seen any code that touches this pin at all, so it is probably
floating and both mine as well as the kernelci board are from an early
production run, so I guess it is possible that either rkloader configures
this pin or some board change between ours and your board could make
the pin take another state.

Requiring replacement of a bootloader still isn't the best way forward,
so my current idea would be to let the driver know the vsel-gpio via the
devicetree and have the driver then make sure the gpio is set correctly
_after_ setting the regulator voltage.
