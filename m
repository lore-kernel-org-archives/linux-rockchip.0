I'm trying to get a better feel for the tradeoff here.  It seems like
an API complication vs. code duplication.

I don't really think the callers should have to figure out which
accessor to use.  How much of a benefit do we really gain by
complicating the callers?  We've managed for quite a few years with
the current scheme, and it seems like only a couple new ARM platforms
would benefit.
