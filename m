License change is fine.

As Heiko said, dvs GPIOs aren't accepted yet.

Also a nit that you changed the sort ordering of "disable-wp" compared
to the jerry DTS.  Please make it match.

Nothing uses this yet.  No huge objection to having it listed here
anyway but I notice it's not in jerry's dts (even though it is the
same value there).  It would be nice to add them at the same time.

Also a nit that (I think) usually node names have a "-" in them and
the alias has the "_".  Doesn't matter hugely, but makes it match
everything else...


Other than that you can add my Reviewed-by...
