On RK3399:

  # echo f8000000.pcie > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/rockchip-pcie/unbind
  # lspci

Yes, I think .suppress_bind_attrs would be enough to prevent this,
according to my reading of the code and comments:

 * @suppress_bind_attrs: Disables bind/unbind via sysfs.

Then iProc would suffer from the same memory leak in
of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources() [1]. It *would* suffer from the same
domain allocation issues in of_pci_bus_find_domain_nr() ->
pci_get_new_domain_nr() [2], except that all iProc device trees (in
mainline at least) use the 'linux,pci-domain' property to avoid it.

HyperV and VMD drivers use ACPI, which uses neither
pci_get_new_domain_nr() nor of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources().

I think these are all technically broken.

Those are fine then, I suppose.
