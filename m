     no, 42% duty cycle give a stable 1.2v vdd_logic voltage on my 
board. As i explained in the commit, the pwm was default at a disabled 
state before regulator_register success at pwm_regulator probe, so 
pwm_regulator_init_state  function will get  a zero dutycycle from 
pwm_get_relative_dutycycle. I have to change the dutycycle of  fist 
table to zero to match the following check, other wise the function will 
return defualt value(-EINVAL), then the pwm regulator register failed.
