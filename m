The is already timer entry for rk3228 in the DT. And it act as =
clockevent. I guess it work as backup,
but I cannot test it also. In order to not break DT compatibility I had =
to provide one timer to be
initialized as clockevent. And implemented implicit rule the driver =
(first DT timer - clockevent,
second DT timer - clocksource) already exists for other timers.

Yes, you right here. I=E2=80=99ve temporary disable smp_twd to test =
rockchip timer interrupts.
There is no interrupt on the rockchip timer during normal work.

on rk3188
ARM chip/revision specific?

There is timer for rk3228 in the DT. I guess there are situations where =
it can be used.
May be the situations are also acceptable for rk3188? May be something =
like suspend to RAM or
suspend to HDD? I am not expert in that questions. I can do some tests =
if you give hint/link.

So, as I understood you suggest to leave only one timer what can be used =
as clocksource
only. I can implement that, but there should be DT rule what allow to =
setup timer
as clocksource only. I cannot do more without timer framework support.
Looks, like I have to wait your patch to implement that.

Alexander.
