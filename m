Oh! I really didn't consider this case when developing the solution. I
was assuming that the firmware/bootloader would configure the PWM
correctly and leave it activating when booting the kernel.

The PWM chip has always claimed the pins and muxed them to the PWM IP.
So, this means it's broken from the beginning, and my patch is only
uncovering the problem (unless the pins stay configured as input until
the PWM is enabled, which I'm not sure is the case).
