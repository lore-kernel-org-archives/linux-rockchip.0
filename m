Two thoughts about that:

1. Some amount of policy is allowed in device tree.  At some point in
time there was a big discussion about the need for a separate "config
tree" that was totally parallel to the device tree so we could put
policy stuff in that.  Nobody wanted that and (as I recall) it was
agreed that in some cases policy could go there if that policy
expressed policy that was the generic intent of how the board ought to
be run.  I believe this is how things like the assigned-clocks is
justified.

2. In some cases this number does describe the hardware.  You look at
the hardware reference manual and see that there are 3 MMC
controllers: 0, 1, and 2.  In such cases it seems like it's an OK
description of the hardware to encode this info into the DTS.

...from what I recall, one big objection is for SoCs that didn't just
have numbers for their controllers.  AKA I think some SoCs might call
their controllers the "eMMC" controller, the "SD" controller, and the
"SDIO" controller.  They may be nearly the same hardware, but perhaps
the SoC allows for a GPIO interrupt on the SDIO controller and perhaps
the eMMC controller exposes the strobe line or has an 8-bit wide
datapath.  In this case making up numbers does become a bit more
arbitrary and folks didn't like it.

IIRC there was general consensus that it'd be OK to somehow specify a
string (AKA non-numeric) name for different SD controllers.  I don't
have pointers to that conversation offhand and it's possible I
imagined it.
