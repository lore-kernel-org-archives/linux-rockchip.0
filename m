funny, that I never noticed that opps are also specified for
(target, min, max) values.

Thanks for pointing me to the right direction and this seems to
actually work. Although I noticed that obviously the max value
needs to always be the global maximum (1125000 here) for both
opp tables, to make the regulator framework happy.

Thanks
