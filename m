Hi Olof,

sorry that took way longer than I expected, I was slightly swamped the last 
days with general work and the travel to Portland.

The issue with this specific setting is that the soc wants to be more 
intelligent than the kernel :-)
It makes the soc switch pin-muxes automatically between mmc and jtag depending 
on the card-detect status - circumventing pinctrl completely and killing the 
our mmc subsystem in the process.

You can of course still select jtag pinmuxes using the regular linux pinctrl 
subsystem. But as I said, other systems might like that functionality for 
whatever reason.


Describing the value (and others) in the dt creates the issue, that the driver 
code still needs to have a list of "we as Linux want to set the jtag-property 
but not other-property-y" and so on and would therefore rely on the function 
being stable over multiple socs, as otherwise we may end up with function-
names "mmc-jtag-rk3288", ... as the GRF and its contents are notorious 
unpredictable :-) .

Right now we don't have any SOCNAME stuff. It's in the back of my mind because 
we're currently also compiling for example all clock drivers for all 
ARCH_ROCKCHIP socs, so it might make sense to split that up a bit, so people 
will be able to limit kernel size if they like to.

But one thing I stumbled upon is that while some arm32 socs do have per-soc 
kconfig entries, there does not seem to be anything like this on arm64 yet.

Is there a plan stated somewhere already on how this should be handled?
I.e. introducing SOC_RK3399 (or similar) or having separate CLK_RK3399, 
GRF_RK3399 (or similar) symbols that all need to be disabled separately if 
desired.

As stated in the original commit message, the list of settings in there is not 
supposed to get "long", but that may or may not be wishful thinking on my part 
;-) .

I would very much prefer going this route, as I really don't trust the GRF to 
keep conforming to any devicetree binding (or anything at all) and this way, 
stuff is completely reversable / redoable if the need arises (hopefully not) 
and we don't have to live with an inadequate bindings forever :-) .

It's not the only one though, needing per soc updates.

Closed neighbour is probably the io-domain handling in [0], whose binding I 
really like, as it hides the the GRF-shenanigans nicely and only exposes the 
actual supplies.

So yes, I'd like to keep it codified, but we can split that up on a per-soc 
basis as you suggested.
