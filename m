The problem I see here is that we need to keep track of the suspended
state when suspending the (entire) devfreq subsystem. When doing that,
we don't know if any device driver has previously called
devfreq_suspend_device() and might end up calling it twice.

Same thing on devfreq subsystem resume.

I've prepared a new RFC of my series (going to send it shortly), but I'm
not so happy with the current design. I think it would be much cleaner
to keep some suspend_refcount in struct devfreq so that I can call
devfreq_suspend_device() multiple times, while keeping a sane internal
state.

Something like devfreq_device_runtime_{put,get}() perhaps?
