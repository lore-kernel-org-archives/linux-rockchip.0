... and so far you haven't really showed how your workflow is soo
different from that found on a typical x86 or ARM platform not using
coreboot.  Give an example of how your workflow would differ from
using u-boot.

While I can relate to that as a desire, the idea of having a stable
device namespace is something that has been rejected by kernel
developers over quite a period of time for all sorts of devices.

My reply would be... why should MMC have special handling that no
other subsystem has?

Here's another example.  Plug in several USB serial adapters.  Which
USB serial /dev/ttyUSB* device corresponds to which adapter?  The
answer is... it depends on the order you plug them in, which could
well be different from the order in which they are found if the
machine reboots.  That's a very real problem.

However, the answer to this problem is not to find some way to bind
a particular /dev/ttyUSB* node to a particular USB device, but to
use the solution(s) already provided - iow, /dev/serial/by-id or
/dev/serial/by-path trees which give a stable view of these devices.

Now, while that allows the appropriate /dev/ttyUSB* device to be
found, it doesn't solve the "which ttyUSB* entry in the kernel
message log corresponds with which adapter" (which is the basis
of your point #1.)  That's not solved, and isn't purposely isn't
solved for any kernel subsystem.

Another example - I have boards here with multiple RTCs... guess
what happens with those?  Yep, same problem.  They get dynamic
/dev/rtc* assignment.

Another example - I have a board with three ethernet devices...
yep, same problem again, the order depends on the driver probe
order, and they get dynamically assigned eth* names.

The list of subsystems that have this property is large, because
it's all dependent on the device/driver probing order.

So, please answer this question: why should _only_ MMC be treated
as a special case?  Please give a _technical_ reason rather than a
_personal_ reason.
