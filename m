From what I've read on #linux-rockchip:

<wzyy2> rk3288w have some differences:  USB HOST : add ohci, fix ehci bug  GPU : update rev
<wzyy2> VOP, video codec, rga : some bug fix
<wzyy2> hdmi :  HDCP2.2

So from, yes a new gpu-revision, but that shouldn't affect this series.
From the above I guess the hooks into the rest of the soc haven't changed
so rk3288-mali should still be enough and the driver normally can detect
and handle revision differences.

And if there are really severe changes appearing later on _and_ we actually
get special support for the rk3288w in the kernel (googling for rk3288w
mentions it in conjunction with windows 10) there is nothing speaking
against having a rk3288w-mali compatible at that time.
