[ Upstream commit b14f3898d2c25a9b47a61fb879d0b1f3af92c59b ]

Dts files with Rockchip 'gpu' nodes were manually verified.
In order to automate this process arm,mali-utgard.txt
has been converted to yaml. In the new setup dtbs_check with
arm,mali-utgard.yaml expects clock-names values
in the same order, so fix that.
