Er, that's embarassing... I somehow failed to register that my mindless 
copy-paste job ends up adding a new binding that *isn't* the one Rob 
already reviewed :(

...but I completely agree with that idea anyway - as the commit log 
alludes to, this was really just somewhere to move the existing nodes to 
without much thought involved. I'll give it a day or two for any more 
comments, then respin at least this patch and make sure the binding 
update goes to the maintainers properly.

Cheers,
Robin.
