And i think it better to be governor behaviors, for userspace they may 
not want to change
the suspend frequency like other governor, the frequency should decide 
by the user, if they
want this function, they should like other governor to rigister a 
devfreq_monitor_suspend().
What do you think about my rev6 patch?
