that's my point exactly. We can add more support generically so that
other platforms can benefit from the work. PM should be simple for
dwc3-of-simple.c. Dual-role will take a little more effort. In almost
there actually. There are a few missing pieces but it should be doable
(hopefully) within the next two major releases.

Your integration is no different than other companies' using DWC3 in
dual-role setup. For example TI's DWC3 have the same requirements as you
do, so it makes sense to add it straight to dwc3-core. Roger Quadros
(now in Cc) has been working on dual-role for TI's platforms and we've
been discussing about how to add missing pieces generically. Perhaps
you'd want to join the discussion.
