I said early on the DT names and kernel-userspace names should not 
necessarily be linked. They can be, but we shouldn't require that.

My concern with mode-bootloader is what if you can boot into multiple 
bootloader modes. Say USB mass storage is one option. "bootloader" is 
not real specific.

Whatever your OS has defined to map to that.

We could just decide the kernel will strip <vendor> and 'mode-' and 
match commands against what remains.

There is: UEFI. Boot mode efivars are standard. But then they are pretty 
much PC oriented though. It is more which device to boot off of, but 
there is network boot or boot to bios setup.

Yes, otherwise I'd be completely against "mode-bootloader" as the 
property.

Perhaps those are only for development and change would not be so 
painful.

Or vendor specific modes require vendor specific translation in the 
kernel. 

To some extent we need to design what is right and worry about future 
devices rather than cater to past devices. There's always some 
compromise. What would you design ignoring the existing conditions. 
Start there and then figure out how to make it work with current 
designs.

Well, that's nice. Maybe we should change that? Or we're stuck with 
that ABI?

You can just read the DT. Although, the problem then is what happens 
when we move to the next firmware interface. We see that some with 
devices having userspace dependencies on ATAGS.
