Just for reference (not to necessarily disagree here): we've kinda
ping-ponged on this one. I suggested it could be built as a module, so
Shawn added it, but apparently we're missing an export:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/8/704

so he reverted back. It's probably best to just leave this built-in and
resolve the comments Paul and Bjorn made, to avoid too much more
flip-flopping. If we still want to patch up the __weak
pci_remap_iospace(), then we can make this a module at a later time.

Regards,
Brian
