I'll add a little more to my claim about ACPI systems. I chatted a
little more with another engineer on my team who has dealt with ACPI
firmware for a few generations of Intel platforms. Even among the
latest two platforms he dealt with, there have been two different
sorts of chipset bugs (at the host/root complex side, not just the
endpoint) that have yielded different decisions on how to handle
PERST#. This was opaque to Linux though, since that's how system
firmware rolls :)

I expect this will not be the last discrepancy on how to handle
PERST#. And to my knowledge, none of the above initiated any
discussion with the PCI-SIG.
