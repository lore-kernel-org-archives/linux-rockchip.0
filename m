What happens if someone disables the driver using the CONFIG subsystem?

What happens if this is a device that someone has set to 'status =
"disabled";' in the device tree?

Even if the device is disabled in one of those two ways, we still need
the clocks to be turned on.  ...so if we turn on/off the VIO domain we
need to turn on the EDP clock even if there's no EDP in the current
board / config.  We might turn on/off VIO for one of the other devices
in the VIO domain for one of the other devices in VIO that we are
using.
