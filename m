IPA is intelligent Power Allocator.  (As the ARM introduced on

Isn't  arm,mali-midgard.txt document suit for Mali specific? :-)

These value was calculated by running full GPU process.

CPU had the similar value for dtsi.

Say: arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399.dtsi
         cpu_b0: cpu@100 {
             ...
             dynamic-power-coefficient = <436>;
             ...
         };
