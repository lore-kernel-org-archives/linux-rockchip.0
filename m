On rk3399 we explicitly set ppll in the device tree to 676000000.  The
ppll has one major child, pclk_pmu_src, that is the parent of lots of
other clocks.  Right now nobody is setting that clock rate and we're
relying on the divider to just happen to be something sane.  Let's be
explicit in our request so we're not relying on the firmware.

With the current firmware I tested with this patch has no expected
impact but it's probably good to do anyway.
