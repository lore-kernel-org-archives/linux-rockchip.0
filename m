But if you have pwm_round_state (which implements rounding down for
example) you could easily implement a helper that rounds nearest or up.
If however each driver rounds the way it prefers coming up with a helper
for rounding up is considerably harder.

This might be more ugly than needed because then you have to setup the
table in dependance of the used PWM. Looking at the pwm-regulator code I
think the binding is badly worded. The "Duty-Cycle" parameter is used as
second parameter to pwm_set_relative_duty_cycle (with scale =3D 100). So
with the regulator defined in the Voltage Table Example of
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/pwm-regulator.txt you'd have
to configure

	.duty_cycle =3D 2534, .period =3D 8448
	=

to get 1.056 V.

Note that my considerations are not only about pwm-regulators.

Also in general I prefer a suitable and well reviewed algorithm (if
possible) over a requirement to provide a hand-tuned table of values in
a machine-specific device tree.

I don't understand the last sentence? Why is it impossible to get exact
results in continuous voltage mode?
