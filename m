Sure. And I'm happy you found the issue in my patch before it was
applied.

Actually I think that it would make sense to expand the "pwm-regulator
with table" code to interpolate voltage levels between two table entries
assuming linear behaviour on the interval. This way a continous
regulator becomes just a special case with two entries. (Some care might
have to be applied to prevent changes in behaviour for already existing
machines.)

I don't think this would result in settings as optimal as with my
suggestion. If you don't agree and want to convince me: Show how your
suggestion would work with a PWM that can implement only multiples of 3
for duty_cycle and period and you want 20% duty cycle with period <=3D 1
ms (without making use of the knowledge about the limitation of the
PWM in the algorithm).
