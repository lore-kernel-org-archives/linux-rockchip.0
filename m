I vote for drivers/power/reset as well. On some platforms, the two things
are related, on others they are not, but it's good to have it all in one
place I think.

I'd make this one syscon-reboot-mode, to go along with syscon-poweroff
as implemented by drivers/power/reset/syscon-poweroff.c. The syscon concept
is already generic enough that we don't need a linux prefix for that.

the sram mode should probably follow the generic SRAM binding and make
the location that stores the reboot mode a separate partition, unless
we want to store other data in the same partition, in which case we might
want to use the same implementation as for the nvram.

I think "sdram" is not an appropriate name here, as the main system memory
might use some other technology, e.g. DRAM or DDR2-SDRAM.

nvram is a complex topic by itself, because there are so many ways to do it.
I think what you are referring to here is a battery-backed memory that uses
one or more bytes at a fixed offset to store a particular piece of information,
as the drivers/char/nvram.c driver does. Maybe we should put the reboot mode
into that driver then?

There are other nvram drivers at various places in the kernel, and each may
be slightly different, or completely different, like the EFIVARs driver on
UEFI firmware or the key/value store on Open Firmware, these probably need
their own methods and not share the generic driver.

It's probably best to leave these four examples as separate drivers and we can
add further ones when needed.
