If this was so simple...

This is why the "vendor" compatible is optional.

And on another side, the binding were written by ARM, are may not be
compatible with how the mainline Linux handles these uses-cases.

ARM added some tweaks to handle some weird integration using DT properties,
but this should definitely go in platform specific code instead.

Well, if the midgard driver was maintained in community-driven way, all vendor
could actually push their platform code, but it's not the case and somehow
never will.

I understand you would avoid changing the (horrible) way the midgard
driver handles the DT...

But ultimately, if we consider the eventual integration of the midgard
driver in mainline kernel (because why not ?), the driver would need
a complete re-write to conform the actual driver coding structure,
and so would also need to conform to the DT mainline rules.

Please, do not consider the "driver" in dt-bindings discussion, the
way it's implemented is irrelevant here, but the way the IP is
integrated is crucial.
And trust me, HW designers and integrators are very very creative
guys, and we *need* some platform code to handle integration corner
cases not handled by the "IP" driver.

In the case of "dw-hdmi", the "driver" acts like a "library" that
can be used differently among the various platforms.

I can talk about the "meson" Amlogic integration, in this particular
case Amlogic used their owm PHY and wrapped all the stuff in a way
we need to handle the PHY+HDMI+Wrapper in a single block and then
connect it to the Video pipeline.

For the midgard integration made by Amlogic, the vendor platform code
uses tweaks to start the IP and initialize the clocks.
And this code is part of the "amlogic,meson-gxm-mali" HW, not the
"arm,midgard".

Trust me, an amlogic compatible is needed ;-)
