The multiple sensors, multiple thermal zones and governors dealing with
different group of them is not implemented [yet]. Basically, you can
consider there is a 1:1 relationship between each of them.

 one thermal zone = one sensor = one cooling device

Given the configuration and the hardware, it would make sense to create
one thermal zone per cluster.

There is one clock line per cluster. It is possible to create two CPU
cooling devices, one for each cluster.

IMO, the fan definition is correct except it should be assigned to one
thermal zone only.

One configuration could be:

thermal-zones {
	little-thermal-zone: little-thermal-zone {
		thermal-sensors = <&tmu_cpu0 0>;
                polling-delay-passive = <250>;
                polling-delay = <0>;

		trips {
			ltz_alert0: ltz-alert-0 {
				temperature = <50000>;
				hysteresis = <5000>;
                        	type = "active";
			};

			ltz_alert1: cpu-alert-1 {
				temperature = <60000>;
				hysteresis = <5000>;
				type = "active";
			};

			ltz_alert2: ltz-alert-2 {
				temperature = <70000>;
				hysteresis = <5000>;
				type = "active";
			};

			ltz_alert3: ltz-alert-3 {
				temperature = <75000>;
				hysteresis = <10000>;
				type = "passive";
			};

			ltz_crit0: ltz-crit-0 {
				temperature = <120000>;
				hysteresis = <0>;
				type = "critical";
			};
		};

		cooling-maps {
			map0 {
				trip = <&ltz_alert0>;
				cooling-device = <&fan0 0 1>;
			};

			map1 {
				trip = <&ltz_alert1>;
				cooling-device = <&fan0 1 2>;
			};

			map2 {
				trip = <&ltz_alert2>;
				cooling-device = <&fan0 2 3>;
			};

			map3 {
				trip = <&ltz_alert3>;
				cooling-device = <&cpu0
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>,

						 <&cpu1
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>,

						 <&cpu2
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>,

						 <&cpu3
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT
						THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>,
			};
		};
	};

	big-thermal-zone: big-thermal-zone {

		/* The same as little, except the sensor and the cpu
		  cooling &cpu4, &cpu5, &cpu6, &cpu7 */

	};
};


That said, the idle injection cooling device is for the moment being
developed and that would be a good opportunity to test a real per cpu
cooling device as the exynos5422 has a per core sensor.
