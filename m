I don't think I powered it off entirely, but I did try asserting its PD#
pin, which powers of most of the functionality -- enough that it
apparently causes aborts, but doesn't bring the link down.

OK, so you've answered this question: losing power is hopelessly racy.

I guess it's up to Bjorn as to whether this racy check is useful at all
