  ARM: dts: rockchip: fix property-ordering in rv1108 mmc nodes (2017-07-22 22:41:35 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Removal of the deprectated num-slots property from all Rockchip dw-mmc
nodes. The rv1108 gains support for sd-cards on the evaluation board and
the general nodes get a bit of cosmetic. On rk3288 the evb gains support
saradc and the adc-key connected to it while some more boards also get
their mali gpu enabled (fennec, evb, tinker).

The biggest set of changes can be found on the rk3228/rk3229 combo this
time. It gets core support for efuse, sdmmc, sdio, io-domans and spdif
as well as a separate rk3229.dtsi that will keep the slight differences
between the two brothers rk3228/rk3229. The evaluation board also gets
some attention and abled nodes (regulators, io-domains, emmc, tsadc keys)

But I think the most interesting change is the cpu enable-method for it.
Instead of using the older in-kernel method, we're now also moving to
handling this in firmware via the psci interface on 32bit Rockchip socs.
In a recently merged pull request [0] support for the rk3228/rk3229 was
added to OP-TEE including the psci support and it seems supporting other
32bit Rockchip socs that way is also planned for the future.
