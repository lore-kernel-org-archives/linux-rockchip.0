OK, sounds good.  Thanks!  :-)

I guess when I see the # v4.18+ in the commit message it makes me
believe that the problem only existed on 4.18+, but maybe that's just
me reading too much into it.  ;-)  In any case, presumably anyone who
had these problems on earlier kernels already has solved them with
local patches.
