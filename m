Essentially unchanged from the first iteration from back in august, just
including additional patches depending on that and fixing fractional
dividers on the rk3036 and spdif parent settings.

In v1, Stephen seemed essentially ok with it but Mike put forward his wish
to use his planned approach for connected clocks for handling this.

While that in itself will be very interesting also for handling Rockchip's
armclk generically, we're now in the situation that everything related
to audio output relies on working fractional dividers to produce the
needed clock frequencies, making audio-output essentially non-working on
all Rockchip socs in mainline at the moment.

So I'm somewhat hoping for some sort of intermediate solution here :-)


changes in v2:
- rebase original 3 patches onto 4.4
- add the 2 new patches from other series, that need that change

Heiko Stuebner (3):
  clk: add flag for clocks that need to be enabled on rate changes
  clk: rockchip: handle mux dependency of fractional dividers
  clk: rockchip: include downstream muxes into fractional dividers

Sjoerd Simons (1):
  clk: rockchip: Allow the RK3288 SPDIF clocks to change their parent

Xing Zheng (1):
  clk: rockchip: rk3036: include downstream muxes into fractional
    dividers
