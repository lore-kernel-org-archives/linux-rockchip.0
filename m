Not annoying, as it helps clarify a few things :-)
I think we do need the JPEG_RAW format. The way I see it, using
JPEG opens a can of worms...

... I think that having JPEG_RAW as the compressed format
is much more clear for userspace, as it explicitly specifies
what is expected.

This way, for a stateless encoder, applications are required
to set quantization and/or entropy tables, and are then in
charge of using the compressed JPEG_RAW payload in whatever form
they want. Stupid simple.

On the other side, if the stateless encoder driver supports
JPEG (creating headers in-kernel), it means that:

*) applications should pass a quality control, if supported,
and the driver will use hardcoded tables or...

*) applications pass quantization control and, if supported,
entropy control. The kernel uses them to create the JPEG frame.
But also, some drivers (e.g. Rockchip), use default entropy
tables, which should now be in the kernel.

So the application would have to query controls to find out
what to do. Not exactly hard, but I think having the JPEG_RAW
is much simpler and more clear.

Now, for stateless decoders, supporting JPEG_RAW means
the application has to pass quantization and entropy
controls, probably using the Request API.
Given the application has parsed the JPEG,
it knows the width and height and can request
buffers accordingly.

The hardware is stateless, and so is the driver.

On the other hand, supporting JPEG would mean that
drivers will have to parse the image, extracting
the quantization and entropy tables.

Format negotiation is now more complex,
either we follow the stateful spec, introducing a little
state machine in the driver... or we use the Request API,
but that means parsing on both sides kernel and application.

Either way, using JPEG_RAW is just waaay simpler and puts
things where they belong.

Well, I've always thought this was kind of suboptimal.
