Yup. It's a useful tool but not perfect!

Stops tend to be pretty quick as no need to wait for stuff to stabilize.
It's pretty rare to have a value for them - however, I guess if there
was one in the driver maybe just add a comment that says 'from driver
+ link'.

If you are sleeping long enough a single check + fail if not ready is fine.

Can do no 3 wire initially as long as we check for dt-binding and error
out with a helpful message.  It'll be a feature someone else can figure
out how to add later.

IMUs are about as hard as it gets for sensors!  This one is far from the most complex, but
none the less there are a lot of things going on.
