rocket_reset() calls drm_sched_stop(), which stops the scheduler and
returns. It does not wait for a threaded handler that is already running,
so the comment that follows, "Remaining interrupts have been handled",
states an assumption rather than something the code arranges.

Call synchronize_irq(core->irq) after drm_sched_stop() and reword the
comment to say what holds afterwards.

It has to go before the scoped_guard(mutex, &core->job_lock) rather than
inside it. rocket_job_handle_irq() takes job_lock, so waiting for the
handler while holding that lock would be waiting for a handler that is
waiting for us. Nothing is held at that point: drm_sched_job_timedout()
drops job_list_lock before calling ->timedout_job(), and the only live
caller, rocket_job_timedout(), runs in process context, so sleeping there
is allowed.

This does not stop a handler that has already read in_flight_job from
finishing its work on the job the reset is about to drop. That window needs
the check and the register writes to be one step under the lock, which is
what the previous patch does; the two are complementary.

Mask the block before the sync as well. INTERRUPT_MASK is armed by
hw_submit() on every submit and cleared only by the hardirq, so on an
ordinary timeout it is still live and a completion can arrive after
synchronize_irq() returns. Nothing is lost by clearing it, since the next
submit arms it again.

That mask write goes UNDER job_lock, though the sync does not.
rocket_job_hw_submit() arms the same register and always runs under that
lock, while reset.pending is set here without it and read there with it, so
a submit that has already passed its check can re-arm the mask after this
clears it. The block is then left running a task with its interrupt live
while synchronize_irq() fences a handler that has already finished, which
is the same shape of race the previous patch closes for OPERATION_ENABLE.
pm_runtime_get_if_active() takes a reference on an already-active device
without invoking a callback, and pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() is
asynchronous, so holding job_lock across them cannot re-enter this driver's
runtime PM callbacks.

That write is the first register access this function has ever made, and it
is guarded, because the function holds no runtime PM reference of its own.
The only reference in the window belongs to in_flight_job, and the
completion path can have put it and cleared the pointer before the timeout
worker arrives: drm_sched_stop() sits in between and can block on
cancel_work_sync() and on a dma_fence_wait(), and it subtracts every
pending job's credits, so rocket_job_is_idle() is true and
rocket_device_runtime_suspend() will not refuse. With the autosuspend delay
elapsed the clocks are off and both NPU domains are down. A register access
in that state takes an async SError on this hardware, which is the failure
two later patches in this series describe from the power-on side.

pm_runtime_get_if_active() resumes nothing and allocates nothing; if the
core is already down there is no live interrupt to mask and the following
synchronize_irq() is all that is needed. Only a POSITIVE answer says the
device is active, and that distinction is not cosmetic: the helper tests
power.disable_depth before power.runtime_status, so -EINVAL masks a
suspended device rather than excluding one. pm_runtime_force_suspend(),
which is this driver's own system sleep callback, disables runtime PM first
and turns the clocks off second; rocket_core_fini() suspends the core and
disables before cancelling the timeout worker. Both offer -EINVAL with the
domain down, which is the SError this patch exists to avoid causing.

The mask is written with a clear of the raw status, paired the way the
completion path writes them. Masking alone leaves the DPU bit latched until
rocket_core_reset(), and the hardirq decides on raw status alone, so a
fault from the IOMMU sharing this core's line would wake the thread again
and the guarantee this patch is about would stop holding partway through
the function. Igor Paunovic asked the general form of this on v8 -- whether
rocket_reset() should hold a reference -- and it was deferred then because
nothing in the path touched a register. This patch is what makes it matter.

The deadlock this placement avoids would not have been reported. The wait
is on desc->wait_for_threads rather than on a lock, so lockdep does not
model it and it would have hung silently.

Igor Paunovic ran an induced-reset protocol on RK3588. On 19 and 25 August he
ran it with this patch and the previous one removed as well as applied, so what
those sessions show bounds the pair rather than either one of them; the
12 September session ran two patched arms and no unpatched one, so it re-tests
nothing differential. His own summary, which aggregates all three after he
re-ran the protocol on v12 as posted and corrected his earlier reports:

  45 induced resets on 19 August, 102 on 25 August and 74 on 12 September,
  every reset recovered, no MMU faults, no lockdep report from rocket or the
  scheduler in the runs where lockdep was still armed, and of the 420
  inferences scored, 384 matched the CPU reference within 1 on all 48 output
  channels while 36 returned the all-0x80 buffer of a job the reset had
  cancelled. The protocol bounds; it does not prove.

The all-0x80 buffer is not a differential signal. rocket_reset() calls
drm_sched_stop(), drm_sched_start() then completes the detached jobs with
-ECANCELED, and PREP_BO drops the fence error, so that buffer is what a
cancelled job looks like from userspace whatever made it miss its deadline.
