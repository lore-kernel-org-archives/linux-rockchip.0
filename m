Yes I had read this one. I'm just getting higher differences on my
device here.

I tend to agree, especially on low voltages, where the gain in stability
is important while the difference in consumptionis barely noticeable.

OK!

My point is that if you disable cpufreq, the CPU is running at 1.2V, which
is even higher. I don't know why it's running at this voltage, maybe as
the result of initializing some regulators, but that's what we're getting.
So the question about safety of running between 1.13-1.15 resolves to
"it's at least safer than running without cpufreq" in the current state.

And as I mentioned it's clearly linux and not u-boot that is setting 1.2V,
because under u-boot and during kernel selection and image loading, my
board is at 0.95V. It's only once the kernel starts to boot that it bumps
to 1.2V.

So there's something to fix somewhere, either by lowering the default
setting or by increasing the voltages in OPP, but as it is right now the
situation is inconsistent.

Regards,
Willy
