Note that I still believe that we could land the 50 Ohm first (AKA
land the patch Brian posted), but I'm also convinced that my pinctrl
proposal above is not a good idea for the way to move forward, at
least in terms of the "driver strength" part.  Specifically it seems
like the 50 Ohm / 33 Ohm / 66 Ohm / 100 Ohm / 40 Ohm is a concept from
eMMC 5.0 and probably doesn't fit to pinctrl.

I also _think_ it needs to be matched against what's available from
the card (card->drive_strength) and the card needs to be told about
it, but I could be wrong about that.
