I tested this patch again on the latest kernel, and it still results in
the "requesting loading a module with wait allowed while being called from
async context can result in a deadlock" warning from the modules code.
(With the calling code being phylib.)
See the phylib splat that I previously reported in this thread.

Note that I've built the network PHY driver that phylib wants to load
(CONFIG_REALTEK_PHY=y) as built-in. As long as the PHY driver is built
as built-in, I don't think that the problem the modules code is warning
about can happen. (But I also don't understand why it is trying to load
a module when the driver is built as built-in in the first place...)

Anyway, my networking is working perfectly fine even with the splat.


Having async probing for the Rockchip PCIe controller driver, which is
used a LOT of rockchip based SoCs, is a good thing, so I don't think it
is right to avoid enabling async probing just because it results in a
splat on a single rockchip based board (rock5b).


Kind regards,
Niklas
