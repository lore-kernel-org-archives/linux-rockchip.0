Maybe if I had infinite bandwidth, then that would happen, but I don't.
That makes it very low priority for me, as there's no benefit to me to
spending time on it before the merge window, and if I wait until after
the merge window, things get easier, and I don't have to pollute my tree
with unmerged changes from other trees.  So there's actually beneficial
reasons for me to do nothing on this right now.
