I add Greg to this thread, and hope he could shed a light here.

That is completely the same situation annoying me when looking into
drivers/usb where they have drivers/usb/host/ for host drivers,
drivers/usb/gadget/ for device framwork, drivers/usb/gaget/udc for
device drivers, and even surprisingly drivers/usb/dwc2/,
drivers/usb/dwc3/ and drivers/usb/renesas_usbhs/ for supporting both of
host and device functional drivers....

How about renaming drivers/pci/host to drivers/pci/controller,
and then put all pcie-rockchip* files in there, then we don't
need add seperate directory containning trivial Kconfig, Makefile.

I would prefer to rename it to endpoint-framwrok or whatever to clearly
states it is for framework but not the drivers. All the drivers
whichever for host or endpoint should be in controller directory.

This sounds super great to me to make this series into -next for some
days before hitting into v4.17. Then we could simultaneously head up to
see how we could move forward with this.
