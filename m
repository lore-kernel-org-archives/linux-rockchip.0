Problem I'm imagining is this one:

1. EDP (used for builtin panel) is setup by userspace.  It requests a
pixel clock that's not quite achievable from CPLL / GPLL.  Let's say
it requests 67 MHz.  GPLL can make 66 MHz (594 / 9) and CPLL can make
66.67 (400 / 6).  ...but NPLL is sitting right there, so let's make
things exact and set NPLL to 1.608 GHz (67 MHz * 24).  Now we get
exactly 67 MHz.

2. An hour after bootup, the user plugs in HDMI.  The user wants to
use a 78.8 MHz pixel clock.

Option #1: deny HDMI because CPLL / GPLL are fixed and NPLL is in use
by eDP.  Not great for HDMI support.

Option #2: switch EDP away from NPLL to CPLL.  This presumably will
require disabling / re-enabling eDP and isn't super amazing, but could
be done if need be.  Since user space might care about the eDP refresh
rate (so it can properly schedule video frames) and this will tweak
the refresh rate by a bit, this might be cleanest as a full "unplug"
of eDP and re-plug of eDP.

Option #3: Somehow ahead of time know that on this particular device
that eDP shouldn't use NPLL.

--

The whole situation would presumably be different if eDP wasn't used
for the builtin panel.  Technically eDP can be hotplugged (I think).
If we're on a board where eDP could be hotplugged to different
monitors then all the rules might be different.

On the current systems eDP will actually request 72.5 MHz, which is
definitely not achievable from CPLL / GPLL.  You can try redoing the
exercise above where eDP requests 72.5 MHz if you want, but suffice to
say that the eDP refresh rate will change more drastically if it goes
from 72.5 MHz to 66.67 MHz.
