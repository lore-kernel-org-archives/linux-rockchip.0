Hello,

This series adds initial support for the RK3368 based GeekBox.

Since v2 almost a month has passed with none of the first patches getti=
ng queued
despite Heiko offering to squash them himself, so here's a full update.

There were no more replies on the compatible string discussion for Land=
ingship;
I have now adopted Heiko's proposal of using "geekbuying,geekbox-landin=
gship".

v3 does minor cleanups and starts squashing undisputed patches. The pow=
er button
is still left separate, inserting cleanups to align all RK3368 boards a=
t least.

On next-20160304 the GMAC seems to have regressed, it no longer finds t=
he PHY:

libphy: PHY stmmac-0:ffffffff not found
eth0: Could not attach to PHY
stmmac_open: Cannot attach to PHY (error: -19)

=46or v2 I may have screwed up testing the Landingship FDT; I now ran i=
nto this:

rk3x-i2c ff140000.i2c: using default SCL frequency: 100000

[<ffffff8008bc1000>] nonblocking_pool_data+0x20/0x80

Keeping i2c1 disabled avoids that; i2c2 does not run into such problems=
=2E
A quick git-grep shows that I'm the first actual user of i2c1 (and i2c2=
),
so maybe something's wrong with clocks or pinctrl?

Regards,
Andreas
