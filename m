The emmc-phy is fully enclosed in the general register files (GRF).
Therefore as seen from the device-tree it shouldn't be a separate platform-
device but instead a sub-device of the GRF - using the simply-mfd mechanism.

The driver entered the kernel in the current merge-window, so we can still
adapt the binding without needing a fallback, as the binding hasn't been
released with a full kernel yet.

Hi Shawn, Kishon,

I didn't see this new phy driver until now, so I'd really like to get
this sorted before the old binding solidifies :-).

I'll convert the usbphy as well, but that has to have the fallback for
the old binding, so is not as urgent as these two.

As mentioned in the patch description above, this is meant as a fixup for
kernel 4.6.


changes in v2: drop forgotten rockchip,grf from example
