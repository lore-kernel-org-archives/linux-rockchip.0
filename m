I wasn't aware of this. That's definitely a better approach than my
hack, and I would really like this to be revived.

Agreed. If there is no actual use for this, and that we can build a case
for a better solution, let's remove the wakeup support from the Gru DT
(it is invalid anyway), and bring it back if and when we get the right
level of support.

Even on an arm64 platform, there is no reason why a wakeup interrupt
couldn't be handled by FW rather than the OS. It just need to be wired
to the right spot (so that it generates a secure interrupt that can be
handled by FW).

Is the DT binding the only problem? Do we have an agreement for the core
code?

Honestly, my solution is just a terrible hack. I wasn't aware that this
was a more general problem, and I'd love it to be addressed in the core
PCI code.

Oh well...

Thanks,
