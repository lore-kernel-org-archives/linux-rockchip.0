In panel_simple_parse_override_mode().  Specifically:

drm_display_mode_from_videomode(&vm, &panel->override_mode);

You would suggest that I add a boolean field to a structure to
indicate whether an override mode is present?  I will certainly do
that if you're sure that's what you want, but my understanding of the
convention for much of the kernel is that you generally rely on
structures being zero-initialized and then (assuming that zero isn't a
valid value) it's safe to confirm they've been initialized by seeing
that they're non-zero.

In this case panel_simple_parse_override_mode() will _definitely_ set
a non-zero value for this field in the case that it ran to completion.
...and, even further, the end of that function has a WARN_ON() if it
doesn't.

Any chance you missed reading panel_simple_parse_override_mode() in
the original patch?

override_mode isn't a pointer, right?  It's a structure straight in
the panel.  So all its fields will be initted to 0 by the kzalloc in
panel_simple_probe().  If the type is non-zero then we know
panel_simple_parse_override_mode() finished to completion.

Flags here is an implementation detail of the Linux driver and the
bindings are supposed to be Linux-agnostic.  The bindings started out
talking about lots of stuff that happened in the driver and I was told
to take all those out.  ;-)

Specifically note that flags here holds whether we have specified a
positive or negative for hsync or vsync.  These are the "hsync-active"
and "vsync-active" properties of the panel bindings.  Take a look at
of_parse_display_timing().

...so to summarize the flags here is just a different set of
properties to check like the checks above.

Happy to change the name to panel_simple_parse_panel_timing_node().

Summary of the above:

* Unless you say otherwise, I will leave the check of "type != 0" and
not introduce a new boolean.

* Only action request is rename of panel_simple_parse_override_mode()
to panel_simple_parse_panel_timing_node()

NOTE: Since this feedback is minor and this patch has been outstanding
for a while (and is blocking other work), I am assuming that the best
path forward is for Heiko to land this patch with Thierry's Ack and
I'll send a follow-up.  Please yell if you disagree.  I'll respond to
each of your emails separately and then wait for your response before
sending the follow-up series.
