After debugging for a while this is often (not always!) reproducible when DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET=y (but not when built as a module!). The fact it's "not always" is a dead giveaway timing or probe order is involved, more later on that.

This looks like a power domain problem. What would happen if you tried
enabling the regulator for the NPU power domain in U-Boot?

Or did you properly configure the corresponding regulator supply in
the power domain?

Considering rdev->cores is allocated based on the number of available nodes in the DTB with the rknn compatible, if rocket_probe() is called more than the number of available nodes, rdev->cores[core] will result in out-of-bounds access.

It seems hacky. I'm not sure whether this would be better
implemented as a component driver.

> 3. I believe (but I may be wrong) that core 0 is special (do we need to schedule through core 0 maybe?). There's a hardcoded fetch of the device associated with core 0 via rocket_iommu_domain_create(rdev->cores[0].dev); (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c#L88). The issue is that this assumes that core 0 is always rdev->cores[0], which may not be true as it depends on the probe order (which is not guaranteed), which can be exacerbated by core 0 (HW index) probe being deferred for some reason. Is it necessary for core 0 to be the one initializing the DRM device or could we simply use any core for that (just the first to probe, whichever it actually is HW-wise)?

I think this is because multiple cores share the same IOMMU device.

> 
> 4. The actual issue I'm unable to suggest something for comes now. The following is all happening in the context of DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET being built-in (that is DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET=y). You can use aarch64's default defconfig, then DRM=y, DRM_ACCEL=y and DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET=y via menuconfig. Remember that this is not 100% reproducible (more often happening than not).

> rknn_core_0 depends on rknn_mmu_0 as highlighted by the iommus phandle property. rknn_mmu_0 depends on RK3588_PD_NPUTOP power-domain. The parent domain (RK3588_PD_NPU) of RK3588_PD_NPUTOP power-domain has a domain-supply on a regulator on i2c (i2c0@42 for Jaguar, patches on the ML at https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20250812085213.1071106-2-heiko@sntech.de/). When the rocket driver calls platform_driver_register() in its module_init() function, the kernel core will try to probe the associated device, via driver_probe_device(), then __driver_probe_device() and more specifically pm_runtime_get_suppliers(dev) in there (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/base/dd.c#L793). Then this calls pm_runtime_get_sync() on all links, c.f. https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/base/power/runtime.c#L1914. Note that pm_runtime_get_suppliers() returns void. One of the links is the rknn_mmu_0.
> 
> Follow the next series of function calls, pm_runtime_get_sync() on rknn_mmu_0, rpm_resume(), rpm_callback(), __rpm_callback(). This then calls cb(). cb() is set via RPM_GET_CALLBACK(dev, runtime_resume). Due to rknn_mmu_0 device being probed with dev_pm_domain_attach() attaching the power-domain device to iommu via the pm_domain member, genpd_runtime_resume() (which goes to rockchip_pd_power_on()) is actually called. This then calls rockchip_pd_regulator_enable() which returns -EPROBE_DEFER. Going up in the call stack up to rpm_callback() you can see that retval = __rpm_callback(cb, dev); now is EPROBE_DEFER and thus, dev->power.runtime_error = EPROBE_DEFER at the end of the function.
> 
> Then once pm_runtime_resume_and_get(dev); is called in rocket_core_init() during probe of the rocket device, it'll call into rpm_get_suppliers() in __rpm_callback() which in turn will call pm_runtime_get_sync() on rknn_mmu_0 which will go up to rpm_resume() where dev->power.runtime_error will be checked and if non-zero will return -EINVAL, effectively eating -EPROBE_DEFER and failing the probe of the rocket device instead of deferring the probe.
