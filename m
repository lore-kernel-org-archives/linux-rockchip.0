Yes, there are bugs, quirks, even with HID. But the HID declares within
the protocol the Vendor ID and the Product ID, which means once we pass
the initial "device is ready" step and can do a single i2c write/read,
we don't give a crap about device tree anymore.

This is just about setting the device in shape so that it can answer a
single write/read.

I can somewhat understand what you mean. The official specification is
for ACPI. And ACPI allows to calls various settings while querying the
_STA method for instance. So in the ACPI world, we don't need to care
about regulators or GPIOs because the OEM deals with this in its own
blob.

Now, coming back to our issue. We are not special, maybe, if he says so.
But this really feels like a design choice between putting the burden on
device tree and OEMs or in the module maintainers. And I'd rather have
the OEM deal with their device than me having to update the module for
each generations of hardware. Indeed, this looks like an "endless"
amount of quirks, but I'd rather have this endless amount of quirks than
having to maintain an endless amount of list of new devices that behaves
the same way. We are talking here about "wacom,w9013", but then comes
"wacom,w9014" and we need to upgrade the kernel.

I have dealt with that for the wacom modules for years, and this is
definitively not a good solution.

And one additional caveat of this solution is the time between the
release of the new device and its readiness in the hands of the
consumer. You need to push a patch upstream, then backport it or wait
for it to come to your distribution. While if there is a device tree
specific quirk, you just read the spec of the device and applies it to
your device tree and you are good to go.

So no, I don't buy this. If hardware makers want to have fancy way of
initializing their devices, we can cope with those, but I don't want to
do the Device Tree job in a kernel module were you need to recompile it
each time a new device appears.

I agree to have some sort of quirks in the i2c-hid module, but
definitively not a list of devices with a specific initialization
sequence. Device Tree has also been introduced to remove the specific
platform devices, and you are basically asking us to go back there,
which I don't want.

Benjamin
