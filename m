Ah, I see.  You're envisioning a device where active time in "ns" is
more important than the percentage of active time.  Perhaps an LED
where it's more important to have it on for no more than .1 seconds
(so we don't drive it too long and burn it out?).  If we slowed down
the duty cycle and adjusted the period to match, we could get into a
bad state.

This is because only some drivers would be able to read the hardware
state?  I'm not sure how we can get away from that.  In all proposals
we've talked about (including what you propose below, right?) the PWM
regulator will need a PWM driver that can read hardware state.  Only
PWM drivers that have been upgraded to support reading hardware state
can use the PWM regulator (or at least only those drivers will be able
to use the PWM regulator glitch-free).

When we add a new feature then it's expected that only updated drivers
will support that feature.

We need to make sure that we don't regress / negatively change the
behavior for anyone running non-updated drivers.  ...and we should
strive to require as few changes to drivers as possible.  ...but if
the best we can do requires changes to the PWM driver API then we will
certainly have differences depending on the PWM driver.

I guess this is still showing the strangeness of the device tree
specifying a period without a duty cycle.  You just said it doesn't
make sense, but that's exactly what the device tree has.

I'd imagine that the only reason that the device tree specifies just
the period is that it's intended to be there only for clients that
don't care about the specific duty cycle in terms of seconds but
_only_ care about the duty cycle in terms of percentage.  Anyone who
cared about the duty cycle in terms of seconds would presumably also
care about specifying the period (in terms of seconds) in the same
place they specify the duty cycle.

Right.  We all agree that somehow this needs to happen, it's just a
question of the implementation.

Ah, OK.  I must have gotten confused.

Oh, I see.  So pwm_get_period() is actually "lying" about the hardware
today!  So what you're saying is that at boot time we grab the period
out of the device tree but we _don't_ apply it to the hardware, right?
 I was thinking it would get applied right away...

That means that if you call pwm_get_period() right away at boot time
you're not getting the current period of the hardware but the period
that was specified in the device tree.

So all we need is a new API call that lets you read the hardware
values and make sure that the PWM regulator calls that before anyone
calls pwm_config().  That's roughly B) above.

Sure.  ...but you agree that somehow you need a new API call for this,
right?  Somehow the PWM regulator needs to be able to say that it
wants the hardware state, not the initial state as specified in the
device tree.
