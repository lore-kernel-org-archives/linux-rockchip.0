There is something fishy. In the Verb section it says indeed, that it is
the past participle and simple past of inverse. The entry for inverse
however only has sections that identify this word as adjective or noun;
not a verb.

> 	https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inversed

Not sure I'd count this as hint that inversed exists. The entry shown to
me under this URL is about "inverse" and it has

	verb (used with object), in·versed, in·vers·ing.
		? to invert.

Does this mean: "Did you mean invert instead?"

> 	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inversed

Yeah, that's the one I found, too.

I still have the impression that "inversed" is in use because people
don't know better and understand the intended meaning. And this results
in leaking of this word into the references.

In literature yes, I agree. In a novel it is annoying to repeat the same
words over and over again and some variation is good. In programming
however the goal is a different one. There the goal should be to be
precise and consistent.

I admit I didn't look closely here and I assume you are right. If I
understand Oleksandr right this is only an intermediate step and when
the series is applied completely this issue is gone. Still it might be
worth to improve the series here.

My original question was about similar problems with GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.
Are you aware of problems there?

We disagree here. With this argument you could fix quite some things as
ABI.

Oleksandr adapted all in-tree users, so it only affects out-of-tree
users. In my book this is fine.

To make the API more precise and consistent. That's a good goal in my
eyes.
