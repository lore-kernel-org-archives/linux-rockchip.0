Historically for Rockchip devices we've relied on the power-on
default (or perhaps the firmware setting) to get the correct drive
phase for dw_mmc devices.  This worked OK for the most part, but:

* Relying on the setting just "being right" is a bit fragile.

* As soon as there is an instance where the power on default is wrong or
  where the firmware didn't configure this properly then we'll get a
  mysterious failure.

Let's explicitly set this phase in the kernel.

You might notice that this patch is currently very dumb and just always
sets this phase to 180 degrees.  As far as I can tell this is actually a
sane thing to do.  From reading through the Designware Databook it
appears that there are instances where you could still meet hold time
requirements and set this phase to 90 degrees, but nothing I've read
indicates that 180 degrees is not OK also.

As indicated above, adding a delay to the drive is used to achieve
proper hold times.  For a given speed mode hold times are listed in the
spec in terms of nanoseconds.  The hold times are different for
different speed modes.  The actual hold time achieved is actually a
function of Delay_O (an internal delay in dw_mmc, which could vary from
SoC model to SoC model), pad delays, and the drive delay (which we're
setting here).  Note also that by setting the drive delay as a phase we
will get a different number of nanoseconds of delay depending on the
input clock.

Note that, as far as I can tell, this _does_ change the behavior of
rk3288 devices.  On devices I tested, which use coreboot/depthcharge as
BIOS, the SDMMC/SDIO0/SDIO1 drive phase used to be 90 degrees.  Now it
will be 180 degrees.  With my understanding from the Designware Databook
the 180 degrees ought to be more correct and should increase
compatibility.

I have tested this by inserting my collection of uSD cards (mostly UHS,
though a few not) into a veyron_minnie and confirmed that they still
seem to enumerate properly.  For a subset of them I tried putting a
filesystem on them and also tried running mmc_test.
