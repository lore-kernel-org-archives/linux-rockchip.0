One caveat to the never-NULL comment above that I just noticed:

If CONFIG_REGULATOR=n, then regulator_get() actually returns NULL (see
include/linux/regulator/consumer.h), but it also specifically has a
comment right next to that NULL return, saying:

        /* Nothing except the stubbed out regulator API should be
         * looking at the value except to check if it is an error
         * value. Drivers are free to handle NULL specifically by
         * skipping all regulator API calls, but they don't have to.
         * Drivers which don't, should make sure they properly handle
         * corner cases of the API, such as regulator_get_voltage()
         * returning 0.
         */

So, we still don't need to handle the NULL case specially.
