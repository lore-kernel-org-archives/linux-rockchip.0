Hopefully you saw, but I responded to all of your review feedback.  In
the end, I thought it'd be OK to land the series as-is and I can fix
up nits in a follow-up series, though I'm waiting for your responses
to a couple questions first.

It would be ideal if you could confirm that you're OK with this plan
even if you don't have time to respond in detail to my emails yet.  I
think Heiko can land them all through the appropriate channels since
the patches have all the proper Acks.

Thanks!
