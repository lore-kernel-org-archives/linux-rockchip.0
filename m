Thanks.

Glad your are testing - and I hope the uhs tests work.

Alas for us to test uhs - and our user on Arch isn't so experienced. I =

could push him to try different speeds - but to be honest I expect it to =

be beyond his comfort zone.

But its good to here you confirm "disable-wp" works. To my mind it says =

we are sure that=A0 all three changes in the patch are are correct.

Hopefully this will be straight forward to Heiko to accept. Its the =

simple patch of the 3 to accept ;)

David.
