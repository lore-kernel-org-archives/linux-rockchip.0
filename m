Having a standard number of cells (and fields in cells) is easier to
maintain. We've set this at 3 for PWMs and you have already found what
happens when you have a different number of cells. Adding a 4th cell
(and possibly a different form of 3 cells in the case of no channel #
cell) just creates more combinations to parse. And we don't want to go
update all the existing users using 3 cells to use 4 cells just to
align.

If the mode needed to be set in the common case, then I might feel
differently about having a separate cell. But these modes seem like a
special case. How many PWM controllers actually support modes like
these?

Every driver already supports "normal", so that's implied. It would be
pointless to make every driver register that explicitly. It would be
pretty hard to not support normal as that's just ignore the 2nd
signal.

Yes, it certainly is per channel. You may or may not have the 2nd pin
on any given channel. But again, if the client needs one of these
modes, then the h/w must be hooked up correctly to a channel with 2
signals.
