That is great to hear. In Franks mail yesterday it didn't sound that certain 
yet :-) . 
I really only want to make sure people can build a complete firmware from 
source. Without having to rely on binary stuff.

So if you're going to release the op-tee variant for it, we should be fine.

As I've also ordered one of the rk3229 tv-boxes for my boardfarm, do you
have any timeframe for that? [Sorry for being pushy :-) ].

Yep, having smp in firmware is quite nice, as seen on arm64. So I definitly 
encourage this, instead of doing the "legacy" smp option in the kernel.


Thanks
