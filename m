Oh yes - should note in this covering patch, that the 1st patch to 
correct sd card detection; has been updated to v2. Now as this was the 
first patch applied, it may affect the applying the second (and third 
patch). So if these need to be updated based on the v2 version of the 
first patch - just let me know. But whilst sill in the reviewing stage, 
might as well stick with the original post for wifi.

Regards,

David.
