I was thinking something even simpler. I just thought that you could
avoid going into the binary search on the temp to code function by simply
checking if the temperature in the temp parameter is a multiple of the
table step.

I agree that might be a bit of a strong assumption, but then again, one
should avoid over engineering for future hardware, unless you already
know that the coming ADC versions will have different steps, or even
worse, no step pattern at all.

true. but if in your code path you do several walks in the table just to
check if parameters are valid, given that you could simply decide if
they are valid or not with simpler if condition, then, still worth, no?

Something like that, except I though of something even simpler:
+	if ((temp % table->step) != 0)
+		return -ERANGE;

If temp passes that check, then you go to the temp -> code conversion.
