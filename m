I presume that you found the above confusing?  I changed it to:

  - compatible: Compatibility string.  One of:
    - "arasan,sdhci-8.9a": generic Arasan SDHCI 8.9a PHY
    - "arasan,sdhci-4.9a": generic Arasan SDHCI 4.9a PHY
    - "arasan,sdhci-5.1": generic Arasan SDHCI 5.1 PHY
    - "rockchip,rk3399-sdhci-5.1", "arasan,sdhci-5.1": rk3399 eMMC PHY
      For this device it is strongly suggested to include arasan,soc-ctl-syscon.

I kept Rob's Ack since those changes didn't seem too major.  I will
remove it if requested.
