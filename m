I was also just remembering something Thierry Reding said in the edp thread: 
"The names are in a per-driver scope, so "dp-phy" is implied by the device 
tree binding and driver already. You could simply use shorter names such as 
"phy" and "24m" for example."

I'm not sure about updating the binding though, as it we'd need to provide 
backwards-compatibility for the old names as well. So I don't think renaming 
these will bring much benefit, but we can choose better names for followup 
drivers like the spdif.

I haven't looked to much into the i2s stuff yet. But with me getting a grasp on 
the fractional dividers and the hardware drivers making it into the asoc tree 
now, I also plan to give the i2s audio on the Chromebooks a try :-)
