Ah, OK.  :)  I didn't go through and review / test the code.  I just
wanted to make sure we weren't going to run into the same bug I
remember running into before.  ;)

If this is a separate / distinct timer than the main clocksource
timer, then you can ignore my comments.  ;)

...but obviously the comments from Daniel are much more important to
address and it sounds like you're all set for doing that.  :)
