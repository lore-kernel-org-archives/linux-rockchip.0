OK.  I'll need to dig through and figure out how this works.  So this
list will include devices whose drivers are compiled out and also
devices that are marked as 'status = "disabled";' in the device tree?
It would need to do this in case someone had a board that didn't use
one of these peripherals (since we still need to clock it as we make
the domain go up and down).

I took a quick gander and didn't see code that would do this.  Can you
give me a quick pointer?

We also need to really make sure that there are no probe order issues...

In the ideal world, yes.  ...but it's possibly years before all
drivers are added, or possibly they never will be.  To name a concrete
example, unless I'm mistaken, the "hardware crypto" device present in
exynos5250 still isn't anywhere in upstream despite several years
having passed.  There are just so many devices in these SoCs that
aren't used.

Agreed that more documentation about why each clock is needed would go
a long way to helping.

I'd say that the clocks are properties of the device, but I'd again
assert that not all clocks that are owned by the device are relevant
to turning power domains on and off.  If you really wanted to be
correct, you'd add a property like this to devices:

power-on-clocks = <..>;

...this would be a list of clocks needed to power on the device
properly.  If such a property was added that would erase my objection
to that.  Note that you could say that if "power-on-clocks" wasn't
present then you could fall back to "clocks".  I do worry a little bit
about over-engineering, so I guess this could just be a future
improvement...

I guess my point was that this was a reason for doing something like
"power-on-clocks" because it would let you avoid turning on
PCLK_EDP_CTRL (which is listed in the "clocks" of the EDP device but
maybe not needed while powering on/off the domain).  ...or just have
the list as part of the power domain.  :-P

I totally believe that our current hardware definition isn't so
correct (though it does seem to work).  I'd be that devices that never
turn off often don't have a power domain defined (though they
technically have one) because that power domain always happens to be
on and no amount of specifying will allow it to turn off.  An
advantage of what you're pushing for is that it really forces us to
think about exactly what clocks are needed and forces us to specify
power domains more correctly.

I can see it working.  It's more of a feeling of unease.  ...but
that's not a good enough reason to reject something...
