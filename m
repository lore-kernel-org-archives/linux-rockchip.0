This is perhaps where the biggest gap in understanding/view is: I have 
always thought dumb-buffer's "bpp" to mean bits-per-pixel, where, for 
more complex formats, "pixel" is not necessarily a visible pixel but a 
container unit of some kind. So bpp * width = stride.

It would not occur to me to allocate XRGB1555 dumb-buffer with 15 bpp, 
but 16 bpp, as that's what a pixel takes. I have never seen the 
dumb-buffer bpp connected directly to the pixel format (that's what the 
ADDFB brings in).

I may be alone with that thinking, but afaics the documentation leans a 
bit on my interpretation (instead of considering bpp as a "color mode"), 
although admittedly the docs also don't really say much so this may be 
fully just my interpretation:

https://man.archlinux.org/man/drm-memory.7.en

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/libdrm/tree/include/drm/drm_mode.h#n1055

I (mostly) understand all the complexities around here, thanks to your 
replies, and I think I'm ok with the series as it doesn't break anything 
(need to test the v3, though).

I still don't like it though =). And I would be happier with the simpler 
"bpp" interpretation that I mentioned above, instead of it being a color 
mode. But we can't have it both ways, and perhaps it's better to unify 
the code and have the behavior explained explicitly as you do in this 
series, even if the explanation only covers some RGB formats.
