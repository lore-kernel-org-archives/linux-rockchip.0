yes, you could see some others similar capabilities case like
timeoutclkfreq or preset value, etc. SDHCI hope Soc designer to
implement them within the controller but not mandatory.

I agree. But from the code itself, we should still use
SDHCI_QUIRK_CAP_CLOCK_BASE_BROKEN to see if we could get
it from internal register in case of some platforms don't
provide the clk stuff.. Sounds sane? :)

Ahh, it's trivial, so keep it if you want.
