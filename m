Hi Lee,

as we talked about on IRC on friday, here are the patches enabling
rk805 support in the common rk808 driver. As we agreed I've dropped
the cosmetic patches for clk and rtc adding the rk805 to the Kconfig
helptext and I've also dropped the input driver patch, which Dmitry
already applied.

I've also checked that the patches apply to your mfd-next branch.


Thanks for considering these
Heiko
