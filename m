The "generic" part is that it uses the clk phase API for dw_mmc 
implementations where the clkgen controlling interface is outside the dw_mmc 
IP itself. So it's open for other implementations as well.

But if you are more comfortable with it, I can also move it into the dw_mmc-
rockchip variant for the time being, until another user comes along.
