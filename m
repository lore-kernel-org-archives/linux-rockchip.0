As Heiko indicated in the previous patchset, he thought it would be
nice to move the 'pmu_power_domain_is_on(pd)' to before you deasserted
reset.  ...but then I pointed out that you tested that in patch set #2
and it didn't work.

Talking to Heiko offline he thought that perhaps you could make
'pmu_power_domain_is_on(pd)' work if you increased your 'udelay(10);'
in rockchip_boot_secondary().  Perhaps the old
'pmu_power_domain_is_on' was acting like an extra bit of delay and
that's why moving it broke things.


I actually went back and tested patch set #2 and it worked for me, so
I couldn't test Heiko's theory.  Could you go and reproduce the
problem with patch set #2 again and then try increasing the udelay()
and see if your problems go away?  If that works, it might be a
slightly better solution.  Note that I think Heiko had a slightly
cleaner version of your patch set #2 that he posted in response to
your patch set #3.
