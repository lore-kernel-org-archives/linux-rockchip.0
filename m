At least for the Rockchip boards I'm somewhat confident, that they should
be new enough to not have anybody building cludges - especially as I think
LEDs might not be the most interesting device on such boards :-) .

So while I can apply the Rockchip patches, I'm still hoping for some
kind of consensus beforehand, least we roll it back after the fact  ;-) .
