Hi John,

sorry this took so long,

That is good to know ... the TRM probably lost the real information during 
translation or so and only states that hard value. Looking at the rk3368 TRM 
just now, the value really is 20 times greater than the numerator.

Doug had a somewhat similar problem, mentioning the lack of a "bestdiv" 
equivalent that the standard divider provides. I'm not sure if there isn't a 
way to provide something like this and/or make the fractional clock honor 
specific requirments concerning numerator/denominator - any mathematicians 
around? :-)

One could also replace the generic fraction divider use with a rockchip-
specific implementation that somehow handles that.

But then you are again in the situation where some requested rate can ignore 
those fractional-divider constraints? In general I really don't like encoding 
such board-specific behaviour into the generic clock tree, like needing to 
disable parent relationships.

It works for your board now but does not necessarily for all other boards, 
which might require other "hacks" and also doesn't solve the general problem 
for all other fractional dividers we have.
