PX30 and RK3326 are different chips. PX30 has more features. You can simply think that RK3326 is a subset of PX30. The RK3326 is more like a PX30 derivative chip. This is not the same as the previous chips.
So we use PX30 instead of RK3326 for name, and the opening document is only for PX30, we think this is more convenient for developers.
