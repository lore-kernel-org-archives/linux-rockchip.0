This driver is not only for rk805, but also intend for rk816 and furtrue 
PMICs.
The rk816 has one multi function pin(TS/GPIO), when setting as gpio, it 
can be configured as output or input.
Here is simple description from manual: "Thermistor input. Connect a 
thermistor from this pin to ground. The thermistor is usually inside the 
battery pack. (multi-function for GPIO) ".

At beginning, I want to name it "gpio-rk8xx.c", but I found rk808 and 
rk818 don't have gpio function. So I abandon this name and use 
"gpio-rk805.c", but still implement
it as a generic driver for furture PMICs to be added.

Yes, as explain above,  these "OUTPUT_MODE, INPUTOUT" flags are prepared 
for RK816 or furture PMICs.  Maybe these should be enum are better.

Becuase I refered to other PMICs, I see most of their gpio driver is 
merged into drivers/gpio/*,  Only a few are added in drivers/pinctrl/*.
So, it is better to merge the driver into drivers/pinctrl/* ?
