No worries, I've certainly been there and I'm super happy to have
people testing patches.  :-)

Odd that you're having suspend/resume patches.  My first guess for
super randomness would be WiFi.  The PCIe bus on rk3399 causes the
most impossible to debug problems if you try to access it at the wrong
time.  If you disable WiFi do all your problems go away?  I tried
putting v5.0.9 on the kevin sitting on my desk and it seems to
suspend/resume OK (25 cycles), but:

* I just jammed it straight onto a normal Chrome OS root filesystem.
Since that filesystem expects the GPU to be there, I'm just booting to
a serial prompt and the screen just displays the boot splash.

* I didn't try to configure WiFi or anything.

* I'm using the Chrome OS "fallback config" for the kernel (the config
our build system picks if building an upstream kernel without the
normal split config).  AKA:
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/refs/heads/master/eclass/cros-kernel/rockchip64_defconfig>.
I'm not 100% sure everything is enabled there...

* I'm booting w/ serial console enabled and doing my testing with "no
console suspend" which can certainly affect suspend/resume timing.


Best of luck tracking your problems down!  I suppose if things used to
work maybe a bisect would be possible?
