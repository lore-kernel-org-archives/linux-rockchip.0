Hello David,

  I agree, of course coordination is not always so simple, I did not
know Arch didn't have this configured yet.  As for patching, I agree,
but the Tinker has some... peculiarities, I am a hardware guy,
software is a passtime, so my code is not always perhaps up to
standard.  And I wasn't 100% on submitting changes to the device tree
based on a staging driver.  Most of my work has been absorbed into
https://github.com/Miouyouyou/RockMyy .  As for your approach, as I
said, the wifi is the same as I have except for the reset/enables and
the DDR50, which I didn't know the rtl8723bs supported.  BT I have no
in-kernel support for other than enabling the RTS pin to the device
tree, I handle it in user space for now.  I've been watching the
hci_h5 conversation, I'll look into testing these changes/options
tonight perhaps once I make sure our rockchip-dev recipes are still
valid with the newest RC, and can have them committed so others can
test.

Thank you,
-Tony
