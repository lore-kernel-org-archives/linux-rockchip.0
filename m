Though the ROC-PC is manufactured by firefly, it is co-designed
by libretch like other Libretech computer boards from allwinner,
amlogic does.

So, it is always meaningful to keep maintain those vendors who
are part of design participation so-that the linux mainline
code will expose outside world who are the makers of such
hardware prototypes.

So,
- append the compatible to "libretech,roc-rk3399-pc" and
- update the model to "Libre Computer Board ROC-RK3399-PC"
  like other libretech computer boards does.
