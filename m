Yes, try to make this doc stand on its own. It will obviously be=20
incomplete lacking information on where in the DT it goes. So perhaps a=
=20
note stating reboot-mode node location is defined in platform specific=20
binding docs.

The only part of "reboot to fastboot" that is vendor specific would be=20
the magic value. While we can have custom modes, we should standardize=20
the common ones as much as possible. As I pointed out in my reply to=20
John, we can still support vendor specific modes with just a property.

My point is proven. I assumed one thing and you meant something else.=20
Doesn't matter what the mode is, just needs to be clear.
