Well, in some respects it may be better (mostly, handling in the PCI
core rather than each driver). But I'm still unsure about the DT
binding.

And while perhaps I could find time to revive it, it's probably more
expedient to kill the bad binding first.

+1

Today, something simple like NL80211_WOWLAN_TRIG_DISCONNECT and
NL80211_WOWLAN_TRIG_NET_DETECT may work OK, but I'm not confident that
anything more complicated is really a compelling story today (well,
outside of Android, which has a massively more complicated--and not
upstream--setup for this stuff).

True...but then you also need a configuration (enable/disable) API for
it too. I don't think we have such a per-device API? So it would be a
pretty similar problem to solve anyway.

I'll have to re-read the old threads. I don't really remember where we
got bogged down... I think one outstanding question was whether WAKE#
should be associated with the port vs. the device. That might have been
might fault for confusing that one though.

Ack, so we agree.
