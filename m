It doesn't matter that the protocol is generic. The device attached and 
the implementation is not. Implementations have been known to have 
bugs/quirks (generally speaking, not HID over I2C in particular). There 
are also things outside the scope of what is 'hid-over-i2c' like what's 
needed to power-on the device which this patch clearly show.

This is no different than a panel attached via LVDS, eDP, etc., or 
USB/PCIe device hard-wired on a board. They all use standard protocols 
and all need additional data to describe them. Of course, adding a 
single property for a delay would not be a big deal, but it's never 
ending. Next you need multiple supplies, GPIO controls, mutiple 
delays... This has been discussed to death already. As Thierry Reding 
said, you're not special[1].

Now if you want to make 'hid-over-i2c' a fallback to 'wacom,w9013', I'm 
fine with that.
