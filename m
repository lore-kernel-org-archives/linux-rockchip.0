+- power_model : Sets power model parameters. Note that this model was designed for the Juno
+	        platform, and may not be suitable for other platforms. A structure containing :
+	- compatible: Should be arm,mali-simple-power-model
+	- dynamic-coefficient: Coefficient, in pW/(Hz V^2), which is multiplied
+	  by v^2*f to calculate the dynamic power consumption.
+	- static-coefficient: Coefficient, in uW/V^3, which is multiplied by
+	  v^3 to calculate the static power consumption.
+	- ts: An array containing coefficients for the temperature scaling
+	  factor. This is used to scale the static power by a factor of
+	  tsf/1000000, where tsf = ts[3]*T^3 + ts[2]*T^2 + ts[1]*T + ts[0],
+	  and T = temperature in degrees.
+	- thermal-zone: A string identifying the thermal zone used for the GPU
