I was suggesting not adding anything to what's stored in "struct
rk3x_i2c" (AKA don't add t_calc there).  Just set the value directly
in the register here then change all other bits of code to respect it.

That is:

In rk3x_i2c_start(), write:

  u32 val = i2c_readl(i2c, REG_CON) & REG_CON_TUNING_MASK;

In rk3x_i2c_xfer(), write:
  val = i2c_readl(i2c, REG_CON) & REG_CON_TUNING_MASK
  val |= REG_CON_EN | REG_CON_STOP, REG_CON;
  i2c_writel(i2c, val);


You could get fancy and add a new "i2c_update_bits", but that might be overkill.

OK.  Presumably a rk3066 w/ DVS enabled would be a good test?  Reading
the description of commit 249051f49907 ("i2c: rk3x: handle dynamic
clock rate changes correctly"), I see:

    The i2c input clock can change dynamically, e.g. on the RK3066 where
    pclk_i2c0 and pclk_i2c1 are connected to the armclk, which changes
    rate on cpu frequency scaling.

Right.  The same clock will get an enable / prepare count of "2"
(instead of two different clocks getting a count of "1).  ...but
nothing should be hurt by that.
