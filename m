Hi,
  We need to support rk3036 soc platform via upstream, there are
some primary parts for the initial release of minimum system: dts,
clk-pll, smp, and clock tree for rk3036, and additional, we can use
these startup and run to init processs.

Thanks.

Changed in v7:
- removed the patch "make sure timer5 is enabled on rk3036 platforms" (applied)
- removed the patch "add support smp for rk3036" (applied)

Changed in v6:
- add hardware timer in dtsi and some the aliases of basic modules

Changed in v5:
- don't use clk_ APIs in the pll init-callback

Changed in v4:
- add some basic IP modules on rk3036.dtsi
- optimized supporting smp codes

Changed in v3:
- optimized some codes based on v2
- removed the patch "initial set time for rtc-hym8563" (useless)
- removed the patch "pinctrl" (approved)

Changed in v2:
- based on v1, add clock controller documentation
- enable timer5 startup
- add smp for cpu1
- initial set time for rtc-hym8563

Changes in v1:
- add dts, pinctrl and clock tree for rk3036 soc platform

The patchset (6):
6) ARM: dts: enable smp for rk3036
5) ARM: dts: rockchip: add core rk3036 dts
4) clk: rockchip: add clock controller for rk3036
3) clk: rockchip: add new pll-type for rk3036 and similar socs
2) clk: rockchip: add dt-binding header for rk3036
1) dt-bindings: add documentation of rk3036 clock controller
