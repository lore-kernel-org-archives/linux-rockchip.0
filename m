Other approach already support the all of governors.
Before calling the mail, I discussed with Myungjoo Ham.
Myungjoo prefer to use the devfreq_suspend/devfreq_resume().

To Myungjoo,
Please add your opinion how to support the suspend frequency.

No, the frequency should be handled by governor or framework. 
The each devfreq device has no any responsibility of next frequency/voltage.
The governor and core of devfreq can decide the next frequency/voltage.
You can refer to the cpufreq subsystem.

> specific driver, i think the voltage should handle in the devfreq->profile->target();

The call of devfreq->profile->target() have to be handled by devfreq framework.
If user want to set the suspend frequency, user can add the 'suspend-opp' property.
It think this way is easy. 

But,
If the each devfreq device want to decide the next frequency/voltage only for
suspend state. We can check the cpufreq subsystem.

If specific devfreq device want to handle the suspend frequency,
each devfreq will add the own suspend/resume functions as following:

	struct devfreq_dev_profile {
		int (*suspend)(struct devfreq *dev);	// new function pointer	
		int (*resume)(struct devfreq *dev);	// new function pointer
	} a_profile;

	a_profile = devfreq_generic_suspend;

	The devfreq framework will provide the devfreq_generic_suspend() funticon.
		int devfreq_generic_suspend(struce devfreq *dev) {
			...
			devfreq->profile->target(..., devfreq->suspend_freq);
			...
		}	

	or

	a_profile = a_devfreq_suspend; // specific function of each devfreq device

	The devfreq_suspend() will call 'devfreq->profile->suspend()' function
	instead of devfreq->profile->target(); 

	The devfreq call the 'devfreq->profile->suspend()'
	to support the suspend frequency.
