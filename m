Sure; as discussed in my previous emails.

Only one clock needs to be provided with the Midgard GPU
architecture.  It shares the same bus and system memory as the
CPU.  So I'll remove clock-names in patch v3.

In principle, switching to operating-points-v2 should be very
straightforward.  I have smoke-tested the driver with an
operating-points-v2 table and a phandle to it inside the gpu node
in place of operating-points and it seems to be working fine.  At
least it parsed the OPPs and got initialised correctly.

My understanding is that operating-points (v1) are not deprecated
so we could keep the bindings as-is, but please let me know
otherwise and I can try to address that in my next patch version.
In the documentation, it should only be the case of replacing
operating-points with operating-points-v2.

OK, I'm also updating the example with lower-case IRQ names, no
clock-names etc...

Thanks,
Guillaume
