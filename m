Right.  It definitely used to just happen once at bootup and you were
out of luck if that value was bad for some reason or if conditions
changed.  In cases in my own personal experience it was actually fine
to just tune once at bootup once all the tuning bugs in the controller
were fixed.  ...but I can imagine that some controllers could use
delay elements that drift more.  ...and in any case if you're getting
CRC errors trying a re-tuning seems a sensible thing to do anyway
(unless the CRC error was expected).

Looking at commit bd11e8bd03ca ("mmc: core: Flag re-tuning is needed
on CRC errors") you can definitely see evidence that tuning can happen
again after bootup.

I can try testing this if it's useful, but I'm not sure what it will
prove.  I definitely don't want to disable device sleep, so it's not a
long term solution.  Are you just looking for extra evidence that this
is indeed my problem?  I don't think I need any extra evidence, do I?
The fact that patch #3 in this series fixes my problems (plus
debugging I did to arrive at that patch) means we absolutely know that
brcmf_sdio_kso_control() is responsible for the CRC errors that caused
the unneeded tuning.  Setting BRCMF_IDLE_INTERVAL to 0 will
effectively prevent brcmf_sdio_kso_control() from doing anything
useful (except in full system suspend, but that's not the case I was
testing anyway).
