I'd think this would be more of a pwm issue, not something the pwm-regulator 
should need to care about.

Ideally the pwm driver should be able to return some state information even if 
disabled? I.e. deriving a duty-cycle value from its pin state similar to what 
Doug described below (it's either 0% or 100%)

But right now I have a hard time understanding how the pwm could return any 
duty-cycle information for an input gpio to the pwm-regulator, as I assume the 
pwm-driver has to probe (and thus set pinctrl to the pwm function) before the 
pwm-regulator is able to get the pwm handle?
