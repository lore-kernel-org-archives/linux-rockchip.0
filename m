The idea is that if the driver fails to set the exact state if that's
what was requested, then we just fail. If we really need an exact set
of values, then it doesn't make sense to offer the user alternatives
using rounding helpers.

On the other hand, if we introduce an error margin, we could make the
above work. Let's say the PWM regulator requires accuracy within 1%, we
could do something like this:

	state.duty_cycle =3D 100;
	state.period =3D 500;
	state.accuracy =3D 1; /* there's a slew of ways to encode this */
	pwm_apply_state(pwm, &state);

That way, the PWM driver can determine whether or not the ratio of
possible duty-cycle/period is accurate within that 1% requested by the
user:

	ratio =3D duty-cycle / period

	requested =3D 100 / 500
	possible =3D 99 / 498

	possible / requested ~=3D 0.993

In other words, possible is > 99% of requested and therefore within the
1% accuracy that pwm-regulator requested. The PWM driver can therefore
go ahead and program the selected set of values.

No, it's really not any easier to determine the next state to try. The
problem is that the consumer doesn't know anything about the
restrictions of the driver, and it shouldn't need to know. Given the
above, how is it supposed to know that the restriction is "multiple of
3". Just because the two values happen to be multiples of 3 doesn't mean
that's the restriction. Also, we really don't want every consumer in the
kernel to implement factorization (and whatnot) to guess what possible
constraints there could be.
