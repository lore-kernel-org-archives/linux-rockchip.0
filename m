I'll try my best to introduce the situation here. The GRF, 
GPIO0~GPIO3
are register blocks in the RK3328 Soc. The GPIO0~GPIO3 contain 
registers
for GPIO operations like reading/writing data, setting direction,
interruption etc, which corresponds to the GPIO banks 
(gpio0~gpio3)
defined in rk3328.dtsi:

	pinctrl: pinctrl {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3328-pinctrl";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		gpio0: gpio0@ff210000 {
			compatible = "rockchip,gpio-bank";
			reg = <0x0 0xff210000 0x0 0x100>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 51 
			IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			clocks = <&cru PCLK_GPIO0>;

			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;

			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		};

		gpio1: gpio1@ff220000 {
                //...
		};

		gpio2: gpio2@ff230000 {
                //...
		};

		gpio3: gpio3@ff240000 {
                //...
		};
         }

However, these general GPIO pins has multiplexed functions and 
their
pull up/down and driving strength can also be configured. These 
settings
are manipulated by the GRF registers in pinctrl driver. Quoted 
from the
TRM, the GRF has the following function:

 - IOMUX control
 - Control the state of GPIO in power-down mode
 - GPIO PAD pull down and pull up control
 - Used for common system control
 - Used to record the system state

Therefore the functions of the GRF are messy and scattered in 
different
nodes. The so-called GPIO_MUTE does not belong to GPIO0~GPIO3. It 
is
manipulated by the GRF_SOC_CON10 register in the GRF block.

They are both true, but lack of context. See the above 
description.
