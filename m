Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rockchip-max98090: Fix jack detection and event
 reporting.

Physically there is a jackset which includes a Headphone and a Jackset
Mic pin. The patch add thw two pins with the correct pin name so the
DAPM management can find the pin and make the jack detection and event
reporting work again.

The patch also shut up the following error:

 rockchip-snd-max98090 sound: ASoC: DAPM unknown pin Headset Jack
