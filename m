And yet we are shipping quite a few of Chromebooks with touchpads that
are dual-sourced and can be exchanged at any time without any changes to
the software (be it kernel or firmware).

That I simply do not understand. We routinely enhance bindings because
the devices get used on different boards that expose more or less
connections. I.e. quite often we start with a device whose rails are
controlled by the firmware, and so the binding only contains register
and interrupt data. Then we come across board that exposes reset GPIO
and we add that to the binding (bit we do not invent new compatible
string just because there is GPIO now). Then we get a board that
actually wants kernel to control power to the chip and we add a
regulator. Non-optional, mind you, because we rely on the regulator
system to give us a dummy one if it is not described by the
firmware/other means. And then we get another board that exposes another
power rail (let's say 3.3V to the panel whereas the previous one did not
use it). And we add another regulator binding. All this time we have
the same compatibility string.

So in this case we finally got to the point where we admit that devices
speaking HID over I2C do have power rails; we simply did not need to
control them before. The same Wacom digitizer, that you now demand to
add a compatible for, may have been used in other boards where power
rails were either turned on by the firmware at boot time and left on
until the board is shutdown, or ACPI was controlling them (via _ON/_OFF
methods), or there was some other magic. Having a supply and ability to
control the time it takes to bring the device into operating state is in
no way Wacom-specific, so why new compatibility instead of enhancing
the current binding?

And on top of that, currently multiple compatible strings are utterly
broken with regard to module loading (you only emit modalias for the
first component), so having DTS with multiples does not work well in
real life.
