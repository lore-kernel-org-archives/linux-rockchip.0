I took a look previously, and last time I did, there were too many bugs
for it to be useful. You may have fixed the ones I reported w.r.t.
assumptions about runtime PM.

I also recall there being some difficulty with supporting
level-triggered interrupts that way. (This signal has no device-level
mask, and it triggers for all sorts of BT activity. There may not be a
relevant "edge".)

That's nice, but that doesn't answer my questions. Perhaps that's a side
project. The point is that we're clearly violating the documented APIs.
