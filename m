Yes, and I remember our disagreement on the subject :)

As in case of almost all devices exposing two, or more interfaces.

The question is if they can work separately? Ie is it possible to use
only one interface, and have picture only on left/top side, even/odd
lines? Or to have connected interfaces to two independent display
controllers (of course via some dsi bridges)? Btw I have not seen
bindings/driver for the panel, what is the panel name?
The answer for above questions would be helpful.
If the only way of work is with both dsi interfaces, exposing one
drm_panel maybe could be OK.

The point is if the panel has two interfaces it should be his
responsibility for handling it, not the poor DSI host, which is just for
converting native video signal (RGB I guess) to DSI. The other
responsible for the mess is CRTC which actually should negotiate with
panel how the data is split between both channels (left/right,
top/bottom, odd/even, ....). DSI-host here serves only as data
transport, in fact it does not need to know if it works in dual mode or
not (from HW point of view) - dual mode is just something which only
CRTC and panel should be really aware.

See what will happen to your solution if in next version of hardware vendor:
1. replace dual-panel with two panels glued together.
2. replace DSI bridges with different ones.
3. replace only one DSI briges - ie two different bridges working in
dual mode.

As I said I do not insist on the solution, but I want to show you it can
be dead-end. On the other side maybe dual dsi solutions will die
eventually soon, so there is no point in polishing it :)
