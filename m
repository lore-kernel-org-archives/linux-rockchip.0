=46rom my first impression I agree, as that is the policy we have been
sticking to when writing to persistent EXT_CSD registers.
Although, in this case, I am actually wondering on what is the best app=
roach.

Is there really ever a case when we don't want auto BKOPS to be default=
 enabled?
I think BKOPS is a fundamental feature of an FTL and I can't see a
reason to why we need to involve mmc-utils/userspace to enable it. Am
I wrong?

Kind regards
