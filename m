I didn't review this closely (and I don't know ASoC that well), but this
does fix regressions I've seen on 4.15 RCs, where

(a) the rt5514 DAI link doesn't get set up
(b) the rt5514 *always* causes my device to wake up, because we arm the
    wakeup IRQ even though we never actually configured the DSP
(c) there are system crashes on resume because the rt5514-spi driver
    assumes that the DAI link was correctly configured (that's the
    subject of another patch I sent [1]

I believe this was working fine on 4.14? At least, I know (b) didn't
happen, and I'm not sure about (a). (c) is a new issue in 4.15-rc1.

Anyway, that's all to say:

Tested-by: Brian Norris <briannorris@chromium.org>

on the "kevin" Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook Plus).

I also suspect this might be regression-fixing material, for 4.15. Or if
not, at least something like patch [1] should be.

Thanks,
Brian
