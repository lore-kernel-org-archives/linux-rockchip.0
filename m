Hi Marc,

Thanks for the series. I have a few bits of history to add to this, and
some comments.

You're not the first person to notice this. All the motivations are not
necessarily painted clearly in their cover letter, but here are some
previous attempts at solving this problem:

[RFC PATCH v11 0/5] PCI: rockchip: Move PCIe WAKE# handling into pci core
https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20171225114742.18920-1-jeffy.chen@rock-chips.com/
http://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20171226023646.17722-1-jeffy.chen@rock-chips.com/

As you can see by the 12th iteration, it wasn't left unsolved for lack
of trying...

Frankly, if a proper DT replacement to the admittedly bad binding isn't
agreed upon quickly, I'd be very happy to just have WAKE# support
removed from the DTS for now, and the existing mwifiex binding should
just be removed. (Wake-on-WiFi was never properly vetted on these
platforms anyway.) It mostly serves to just cause problems like you've
noticed.

One problem Rockchip authors were also trying to resolve here is that
PCIe WAKE# handling should not really be something the PCI device driver
has to handle directly. Despite your complaints about not using in-band
TLP wakeup, a separate WAKE# pin is in fact a documented part of the
PCIe standard, and it so happens that the Rockchip RC does not support
handling TLPs in S3, if you want to have decent power consumption. (Your
"bad hardware" complaints could justifiably fall here, I suppose.)

Additionally, I've had pushback from PCI driver authors/maintainers on
adding more special handling for this sort of interrupt property (not
the binding specifically, but just the concept of handling WAKE# in the
driver), as they claim this should be handled by the system firmware,
when they set the appropriate wakeup flags, which filter down to
__pci_enable_wake() -> platform_pci_set_wakeup(). That's how x86 systems
do it (note: I know for a fact that many have a very similar
architecture -- WAKE# is not routed to the RC, because, why does it need
to? and they *don't* use TLP wakeup either -- they just hide it in
firmware better), and it Just Works.

So, we basically concluded that we should standardize on a way to
describe WAKE# interrupts such that PCI drivers don't have to deal with
it at all, and the PCI core can do it for us. 12 revisions later
and...we still never agreed on a good device tree binding for this.

IOW, maybe your wake-up sub-node is the best way to side-step the
problems of conflicting with the OF PCI spec. But I'd still really like
to avoid parsing it in mwifiex, if at all possible.

(We'd still be left with the marvell,wakeup-pin propery to parse
specifically in mwifiex, which sadly has to exist because....well,
Samsung decided to do chip-on-board, and then they failed to use the
correct pin on Marvell's side when wiring up WAKE#. Sigh.)

Ack. That mistake was repeated in other drivers and has since been fixed
in those. We need it here too.
