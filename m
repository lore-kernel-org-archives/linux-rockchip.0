It was obviously changed in the commit bdc48fa11e46, by making the
80-column width preferred, instead of if being mandatory.  The way
I read the changes to the coding style introduced in that commit,
it's now possible to go over 80 columns, up to 100 columns, _if_
that actually improves the readability of the source code.

Just like enforcing the 80-column blindly can make the code much
less readable, it's also that going liberally to 100 columns can
make the code even less readable.  To me, those rules aren't to be
followed blindly, but the resulting readability of the code should
be the deciding factor for pretty much each line of the code.

Again, I think that the readability should be the deciding factor.
