Yes, your patch looks good to me, so it should be merged firstly. :)
Then let's push it a bit further more that when HLEs are coming,
somethings must be wrong(currently I don't see a obvious clue from
the code itself although, I'm prone to think it belongs to the
software issue).

Sure, some of rockchip Socs use gpio for CD because they don't
have a internal CD, such as RK3036, right?

Not at all.

Right, grf_force_jtag is also not a friend of mine. :)
So I had disabled this function before I was debugging it.

Ahh... take back my question.. I was just considering a wired situation
that pins are unmuxed on the background(cmd line as well) when cmd13 is
delivering....

Actually no. Any cmds be issued can trigger HLEs, I think, after sd car=
d=20
is removed When I hacked mmc_sd_detecd to send other cmds intead
of cmd13.

 From dw_mmc databook v270a(7.2.3 Clock Programming) we can see:
The DWC_mobile_storage loads each of these registers only when the
start_cmd bit and the Update_clk_regs_only bit in the CMD register are
set. When a command is successfully loaded, the DWC_mobile_storage
clears this bit, unless the DWC_mobile_storage already has another
command in the queue, at which point it gives an HLE (Hardware Locked
Error); for details on HLEs, refer to =E2=80=9CError Handling=E2=80=9D =
on page 233.
Software should look for the start_cmd and the Update_clk_regs_only
bits, and should also set the wait_prvdata_complete bit to ensure that
clock parameters do not change during data transfer.

Maybe the cmd is trying to load(or somethings wrong with the
controller?) when we disable the clk? That may explain my observation
that HLEs came after disabling clk.
