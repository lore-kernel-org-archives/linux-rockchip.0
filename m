We need the OTP pin is gpio state before resetting the TSADC controller,
since the tshut polarity will generate a high signal.

Says:
The TSHUT temperature is setting more than 80 degree, the default
tshut polarity is HIGH.

If T > 80C, the OTP output the High Signal.
If T < 80C, the OTP output the Low Signal.

On the moment, the TSADC controller is reset, the tshut polarity will be
Low in a short period of time.

So:
If T < 80C, the OTP output the High Signal.
If T > 80C, the OTP output the Low Signal.

In some cases, the OTP pin is connected to the PMIC, maybe the PMIC can
accept the reset response time to avoid this issue.

In other words, the system will be always reboot if we make the OTP pin
is connected the others IC to control the power.

This series patchs are depend on Doug's patch.(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7454081/)

This series patchs are based on the Linus master branch.

Tested on box board.


Changes in v1:
  - As the Doug comments, add the 'init' property to sync document.
  - As the Doug comments, drop the thermal driver patchs since
    we can with pinctrl changing to work.
  - As the Doug's patch to add the 'init' property.
