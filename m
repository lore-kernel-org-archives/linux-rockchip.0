You're right, I missed that the updated state was saved.

My intention here is more to make all drivers behave the same way and
because only two drivers updated the pwm_state this was the variant I
removed.

When you say that the caller might actually care about the exact
parameters I fully agree. In this case however the consumer should be
able to know the result before actually applying it. So if you do

	pwm_apply_state(pwm, { .period =3D 17, .duty_cycle =3D 12, ...})

and this results in .period =3D 100 and .duty_cycle =3D 0 then probably the
bad things you want to know about already happend. So my idea is a new
function pwm_round_state() that does the adaptions to pwm_state without
applying it to the hardware. After that pwm_apply_state could do the
following:

	rstate =3D pwm_round_state(pwm, state)
	pwm.apply(pwm, state)
	gstate =3D pwm_get_state(pwm)

	if rstate !=3D gstate:
		warn about problems

But before doing that I think it would be sensible to also fix the rules
how the round_state callback is supposed to round.

Apart from that I agree that pwm_get_state should return the actually
implemented configuration.

Uwe
