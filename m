Hi Grygorii, Doug and Heiko,

Thanks for your replies.
I will do 2 steps:

1. Add "suspended" flag in suspend_noirq()/resume_noirq() callback to 
prevent new i2c started, and use i2c_lock_adapter() to wait for current 
i2c transfer finished.

2. IRQF_NO_SUSPEND added could make i2c work well during the time 
between suspend_device_irqs() and i2c_suspend_noirq() callback. In the 
other side, it is the the time between resume_device_irqs() and 
i2c_resume_noirq() callback.

If any i2c client try to access I2C after suspend_noirq() or before 
resume_noirq() callback, print the warning, and they should fix it, not 
to start i2c access and the moment.
