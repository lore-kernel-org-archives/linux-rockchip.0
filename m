From: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

Because of the inexact nature of the extra MMC delay elements (it's
not possible to keep the phase monotonic and to also make phases (mod
90) > 70), we previously only allowed phases (mod 90) of 22.5, 45,
and 67.5.

But it's not the end of the world if the MMC clock phase goes
non-monotonic.  At most we'll be 25 degrees off.  It's way better to
test more phases to look for bad ones than to be 25 degrees off, because
in the case of MMC really the point is to find bad phases and get as far
asway from the as possible.  If we get to test extra phases by going
slightly non-monotonic then that might be fine.  Worst case we would
end up at a phases that's slight differnt than the one we wanted, but
at least we'd still be quite far away from the a bad phase.

Fold in more precise variance-values of 44-77 instead of 40-80.
Fold in the actual removal of the monotonic requirement and adapt
patch message accordingly.
