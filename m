Hello:
  This patch could enabled the es8328 codec at firefly reload board,
but it doesn't not really work. I disable the mute of channel 
Left mix and Right mix in alsamixer, I could hear the noise from
my headphone, but it never be a music. 
  I just send this patch here to see whether somebody could figure
out what is wrong, I am really not familiar with sound.
