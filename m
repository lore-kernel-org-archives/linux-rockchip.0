Thank you all for providing inputs and comments on previous versions of
this patchset.
Especially thanks to the (Doug, Rob....).

We need the OTP pin is gpio state before resetting the TSADC controller,
since the tshut polarity will generate a high signal.

Says:
The TSHUT temperature is setting more than 80 degree, the default
tshut polarity is HIGH.

If T > 80C, the OTP output the High Signal.
If T < 80C, the OTP output the Low Signal.

On the moment, the TSADC controller is reset, the tshut polarity will be
Low in a short period of time.

So:
If T < 80C, the OTP output the High Signal.
If T > 80C, the OTP output the Low Signal.

In some cases, the OTP pin is connected to the PMIC, maybe the PMIC can
accept the reset response time to avoid this issue.

In other words, the system will be always reboot if we make the OTP pin
is connected the others IC to control the power.

This series patchs are depend on Doug's patch.(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7454311/)

This series patchs are based on the Linus master branch.

Changes in v4:
  - take the Doug's commit as correct decription.

Changes in v3:
  - Add the pictrl states decription in document.
  - Add the pinctrl state for in the suspend/resume.
  - Add the "sleep" pinctrl as the gpio state in PATCH[3/3]

Changes in v2:
  - Add the 'init' pinctrl more decription in commit.
  - Fix the subject to make more obvious in PATCH[1/2]
  - Resend this patch v2 since fix the subject to be specific.
  - Add some commits for more obvious in PATCH[2/2]

Changes in v1:
  - As the Doug comments, add the 'init' property to sync document.
  - As the Doug comments, drop the thermal driver patchs since
    we can with pinctrl changing to work.
  - As the Doug's patch to add the 'init' property.
