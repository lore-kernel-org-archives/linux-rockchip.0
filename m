I hadn't seen that yet ... nice that cpufreq-dt now also supports clust=
ers :-)

The other part still stands though, as we probably should register the=20
platform-device somewhere else and not in some new special module.

When everything is using cpufreq-dt now, I guess we could just add it t=
o the=20
core rockchip clk-code. Or was there some agreement where this should b=
e done=20
(obviously not the devicetree itself)?
