I think you also felt  that this patch is workaround. 
Because it's not clearly why occurred the CRC error and resuming fails.
(CRC error should be disappeared when clock is used to the lower value..)

And I'm not sure that 100K is enough..If 100k also didn't work fine at resuming time, how we do?
This issue is interesting..because it's possible to occur in real case...I have also seen the similar issue.
But my solution also was workaround.  :(

If it's more clearly than now, i can agree your patch..but now..i don't know what is correct. 
I will listen Ulf and other guys's opinions..also yours.

Jaehoon Chung
