As you can probably guess, again a description would be nice.  Like maybe:

The i2c timing specs are really just constant data.  There's no reason
to write code to init them, so move them out to structures.  This not
only is a cleaner solution but it will reduce code duplication when we
introduce a new variant of rk3x_i2c_calc_divs() in a future patch.

That helps someone reading the patch understand the motivation.

There are more spec values than are currently used in this patch.
Personally I'm OK with that, but if you wanted to be totally clean
this patch would only include the spec values that were needed, then
introduce the additional values in the rk3399 patch.

aside (feel free to ignore): Gosh, I kinda forgot what the heck this
value was for.  I guess it's not anything in the spec.  I have a
feeling it was some sort of slop value that someone felt was
necessary, but I don't quite remember.  Oh well, I guess we leave it
there since I'd rather not mess with timings on old hardware that are
apparently working for everyone.  :-P


In any case, aside from the missing description:

IMHO this can be applied any time independent of any earlier patches.
