Hello,

+To: kever, as he may have some insight on the differences between
RK3528 and RK3528A.

I wouldn't be too worried about getting this wrong, the only set-in-
stone part of this is the name of the device tree for devices and the
compatible; we can still rename rk3528.dtsi to rk3528a.dtsi and shuffle
things around internally. Furthermore, if the only difference is
something that can be enumerated at runtime (e.g. if a different set
of supported features in the crypto accel is identifiable with some
config register bits initial value), then I don't think we need to
distinguish them at all.

As another data point, rkbin mentions "Add support for rk3528A" in the
changelog file `doc/release/RK3528_EN.md` for `rk3528_bl31_v1.15.elf`.

Someone could contrast and compare that BL31 binary with the v1.14 one
to see if they have any immediately obvious differences.

My personal guess for what happened here is that they switched
the packaging process after release to optimize supply, like what
happened with RK3568 -> RK3568B2, and the only change is some OTP
values to identify the chip variant. This would also explain why
everything we've seen on the market so far, at least to my knowledge,
has been RK3528A.

Kind regards,
Nicolas Frattaroli
