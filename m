Hi Mark, thanks for following the long thread.
The end of the discussion was at
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/20/1397

Quoted from Daniel's suggestion:
"
I need to think about this more, but if all we need to look at is
hdmi_codec, then I think this becomes a lot easier. And we can ignore
drm_audio_component.h completely.
"

My thought is that the codec driver under ASoC are only these two:
hdac_hdmi.c and hdmi-codec.c  ( forgive me if I missed others. I just
grep "hdmi" under sound/soc/codecs/ )
hdac_hdmi.c is like a wrapper for HDA and drm_audio_components.
hdmi-codec.c is the only other codec driver that cares HDMI under ASoC.
So adding the jack/eld support at hdmi-codec driver can cover the
existing use cases for HDMI codec driver in ASoC.
That said, adding a new unified approach for Jack/ELD notification
that will only be used by hdmi-codec seems not a high priority.
Hope this explanation helps your decision.
Thanks!
