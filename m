If I remember correctly, labels make it to the DTB when building it with symbols (-@, enabled whenever there's a DTSO for the board; see __symbols__ node when decompiling), this will unnecessarily bloat the final DTB.

Typically, you could need to update the driver (and its binding) to accept and control power supplies so that you can link the two together in the device tree. I'm assuming for an RTC it doesn't make much sense to have its power supply controllable as it likely needs to be powered even when the device is turned off (otherwise the RTC stops counting :) ).

Yes, this seems unnecessary, which is why I'm asking if you've
encountered similar designs before.

Thank you for provide these info. I will try to add them in v3.

Oh! I did overlook that point! I will try to do it in v3.

No, the "vcc5v0_device" serves as the vin-supply for both
"VCC5V0_USB3_HOST0" and "VCC5V0_USB3_HOST1". 
And "VCC5V0_USB3_HOSTx" is supply for USB VBUS.

All the names marked here are those shown in the schematic. As you
suggested, it would be better to set regulator-name to the schematic
name "VCC5V0_USB3_HOSTx" and use "usbx_vbus" for the label.
