I will try to run some tests using this patch on my different rk3328 devices tomorrow.
One thing I have noticed is that when vdd_logic is less then 1.05v the network connection gets super slow.

Earlier I tried to use devfreq and an opp table for gpu, but that caused vdd_logic to use lower voltage.
I have since then run gpu driver without devfreq/opp table and vdd_logic is using default 1.1v.
My board seems much more stable using default 1.1v for vdd_logic.

Jonas
