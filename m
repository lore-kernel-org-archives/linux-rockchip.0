Here are a few thoughts.

In general, I think the best would be to get rid of the (affected)
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS cases.

Now, I guess this can be pretty hard for a PCI controller driver, as you can't
really predict what ends up being probed from you async context, i.e. it could
even be some other bus controller and things could even propagate further.

Not sure how big of a deal it is in practice though, there are not a lot of
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS drivers (left), but note that specifying neither
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS nor PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS currently results in
synchronous by default.

(Also, quite some other PCI controller drivers do set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS
and apparently got lucky with it.)

From a driver-core perspective I think we're rather limited on what we can do;
we are already in async context at this point and can't magically go back to
initcall context.

So, the only thing I can think of is to kick off work on a workqueue, which in
the end would be the same as the deferred probe handling.

Another alternative would be to let the subsystem handle such cases, which in
this case would probably mean to handle the current_is_async() case in
pci_host_probe() or pci_bus_add_devices().

On the other hand, this would probably end up to be a subsystem specific
implementation of "kick of work on a workqueue".
