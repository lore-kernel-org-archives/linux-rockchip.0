I asked myself the same question and even I thought in just remove that code.

After some investigation, though, I saw that the UTMI+ specification [1] has two
signals similar to ID signal (page 11), the AValid signal is used to indicate if
the session for an A-peripheral is valid and the BValid signal that is used to
indicate if the session for a B-peripheral is valid. I suppose that use of one
or the other matters in some cases, but AFAICT this is not used and I didn't see
any binding using it.

Maybe someone else can give us more clues on the importance or not of this property?
