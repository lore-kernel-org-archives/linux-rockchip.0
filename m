The newer SoCs (rk3366, rk3399) of Rock-chip take a different usb-phy
IP block than rk3288 and before, and most of phy-related registers are
also different from the past, so a new phy driver is required necessarily.

These series patches add phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.c and the corresponding
dt-bindings.

Changes in v8:
 - Added support for rk3399 SoC.
 - Prepare input clock of phy at probe time.
 - Improved sm_work function to handle phy-port state more clearly.

Changes in v7:
 - Renamed functions *usb2phy_resume/*usb2phy_suspend to *usb2phy_power_on/usb2phy_power_off.

Changes in v6:
 - Changed '_' to '-' for otg-id and otg-bvalid property in devicetree bindings.
 - Fixed the output clock would be disabled more than once while phy-port was going to suspend.
 - Improved the driver to avoid the currently empty otg-port would cause null-pointer dereferences.

Changes in v5:
 - Added 'reg' property both in devicetree bindings and driver to match the different phy-blocks.

Changes in v4:
 - Used 'phy-supply' instead of 'vbus_*-supply'.

Changes in v3:
 - Supplemented some hardware-description into the devicetree bindings.
 - Resolved the mapping defect between fixed value in driver and the property
   in devicetree.
 - Code cleanup.

Changes in v2:
 - Specified more hardware-description into the devicetree bindings.
 - Optimized some process of driver.
