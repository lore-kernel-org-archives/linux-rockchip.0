     Yep, the SMC is not ready yet.

     Thank you for your reply,  it is good idea use if or #if to 
distinguish the TrustZone whether ready,
     i will handle it in next version. I may follow Heiko advice to do 
some modify in dmc clock and rk3399 devfreq driver,
     I will upload new version when it's ready.
