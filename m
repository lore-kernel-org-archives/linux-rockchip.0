Hmm, good point. I was mostly tipped off by checkpatch when applying
locally, and I also didn't have any context for whether there were any

suppose it's fair to use without documenting it (do I get burned at the
stake for saying that?).

Sounds good. I'm already tracking/testing that modification.
