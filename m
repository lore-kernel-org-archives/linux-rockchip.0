No, unfortunately not.  The only reason I have the PCs is because we
have code to sample CPU_DBGPCSR at hard lockup time (actually any
panic time).  There's no equivalent for other registers.  The code
does try to sample a number of times, so the fact that we only have
one PC value for each of the other CPUs implies that they are either
totally stuck or running in a very tight loop (from experimentation,
if you are running in a tight loop of just a few instructions the
CPU_DBGPCSR for a CPU may or may not update).

If you're curious, you can see rockchip_panic_notify() in
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chromeos-3.14/arch/arm/mach-rockchip/rockchip.c>.
It's basically some code that's been ported forward from code in an
old Android tree and it's not beautiful, but it's better than nothing.
The code only runs if the panic notifier failed to stop the other CPUs
in a normal way.

Technically (I think) I saw something in the CPU debug registers that
would actually allow me to force another CPU to stop.  That might let
me gain control over it and inspect the other registers.  Doing that
is probably beyond what I have time for right now, though.

If they are executing, they aren't executing much.  That means it's
likely they're deadlocked in hardware.
