Now that I'm looking a little closer, it seems like other existing DTS's
are broken too, then. Jerry looks like it was converted to the
regulator-state-mem node binding, but the conversion doesn't seem to
make sense when I compare the chromium DTS sources with the for-next
source I see in your tree.

In -next:

     regulators {
             mic_vcc: LDO_REG2 {
                        regulator-name = "mic_vcc";
                        regulator-always-on;
                        regulator-boot-on;
                        regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
                        regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
                        regulator-state-mem {
                                regulator-on-in-suspend;
                        };
                };
         };

But chromium had:

       regulators {
                mic_vcc: LDO_REG2 {
                        regulator-always-on;
                        regulator-boot-on;
                        regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
                        regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
                        regulator-name = "mic_vcc";
                        regulator-suspend-mem-disabled;
                };
       };

So I guess I'll make the proper conversion for all the veyron variants I
see.
