I admit that I didn't understood the whole situation and (some) things
are worse with my patches applied. I still think that changing the
caller's state variable is bad design, but of course pwm_get_state
should return the currently implemented configuration.

There are currently no rules how the driver should behave for example if
the consumer requests

	.duty_cycle =3D 10, .period =3D 50

and the hardware can only implement multiples of 3 for both values. The
obvious candidates are:

 - .duty_cycle =3D 9, .period =3D 51 (round nearest for both)
 - .duty_cycle =3D 12, .period =3D 51 (round up)
 - .duty_cycle =3D 9, .period =3D 48 (round down)
 - .duty_cycle =3D 9, .period =3D 45 (round duty_cycle and keep proportion)
 - return error (which code?)

And there are some other variants (e.g. round duty_cycle to nearest and
period in the same direction) that might be sensible.

Also it should be possible to know the result before actually
configuring the hardware. Otherwise things might already go wrong
because the driver implements a setting that is too far from the
requested configuration.
