I talked to Kevin about this and we both agree that the power domain's
use of the clock consumer binding is totally valid. So I still think
there might be a use for the generic-ip binding, but I also think the
solution in this original patch also looks sane.

A paraphrase of my discussion with Kevin is that we can think of both
the device (EDP, LVDS) and the power domain as clock consumers, so
basically there is nothing weird going on here. Feel free to add:

I do also agree with Kevin that we have a lot of layering issues to
consider here with description of PM hardware, and there are temptations
to take the shortest route to get things working. Truly modeling
relationships is the best way forward and we need to keep that in mind
over the long haul.

Yes, this is a broader issue with mapping clocks onto consumer use
cases. The same is exactly true for any consumer driver that consumes
multiple clocks and enables/disables them differently (e.g. interface
clocks versus functional clocks). How to convey that in DT?
