The following are the all 3 cases about data role changing:

1. "USB host only" mode(power_count ==1), switch to "USB device" mode
we can re-init phy by phy_power_off and then phy_power_on

2. "USB host + DP" mode(power_count ==2), switch to "USB device" mode
The phy can not support ufp+dp, so it is reasonable to do nothing. 
Moreover, does this situation exist?

3. "USB device" mode (power_count ==1), switch to "USB host only" or 
"USB host + DP"
it is similar with case 1, dp or usb host can re-init the phy again.
