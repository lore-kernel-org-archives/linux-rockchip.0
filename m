As the @Arnd suggestion,

That's seem ok for me.
Although the writel_relaxed() and writel() a bit different  with DSB()=20
and L2's sync.

Do I need send the patch v3?  I will test that on my board.

I'm no sure that why the clocksource driver didn't use the=20
writel_relaxed() to work.
Okay, I think we should according to the suggestion or required.
