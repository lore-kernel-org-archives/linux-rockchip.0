Ok, seems I need to improve a bit more my English skills. :)

after -> between ?

Then, if I understand correctly, this (found in another binding that I
used as reference)

- post-power-on-delay-ms : Delay in ms after powering the card and
        de-asserting the reset-gpios (if any)

means,

Power the card, de-asserting reset, delay ?

 Enric.
