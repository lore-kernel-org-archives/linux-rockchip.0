I think having the registers in dts isn't a bad idea. It might be
actually even useful to bring up this PHY on new SoCs, if they happen
to have the same PHY, just different plumbing.

But I suppose we don't need two separate compatible strings for phy0
and phy1 anymore as Rob pointed, just one "rockchip,rk3399-typec-phy".

After the above is fixed and underscores in property names are
replaced with dashes, feel free to add my Reviewed-by.

Best regards,
Tomasz
