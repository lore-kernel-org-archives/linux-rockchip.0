No, the little cluster of 4 cores is rated at 1.2GHz max, while the big
cluster of 4 cores is rated at 1.5Ghz

Current submitted OPPs can be found at
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9908519/

There were still issues with higher frequencies, so they don't list the
1.2 or 1.5GHz yet.

But opp sets pretty tight constraints. I.e. OPPs have of course one
preferred voltage, so you end up with u_volt_min = u_volt_max for each
operating point, thus the regulator also gets set in this way, removing any
intersection and thus making the regulator framework fail to set a voltage
for one of the clusters.

So for example, you have one cluster running at 600MHz@0.95V and the
other cluster running at 1008MHz@1.05V this results in regulator
constraints being
	0.95V-0.95V
and
	1.05V-1.05V
thus no intersection and whoever comes second looses.

Only one of the two clusters can do that, see above.

Yeah, with dt (and OPPs) being a hardware description that is true.
