We did talk about this internally and while we refined the actual code 
change, it seems I forgot to look at the commit message itself.

This behaviour (and the wish to not overflow a target clock rate) should be 
the same on all socs, so the commit message is quite a bit to Rockchip 
specific. I think I would go with something like:

----------- 8< ------------
When changing the clock-rate, currently a new parent is set first and a 
divider adapted thereafter. This may result in the clock-rate overflowing
its target rate for a short time if the new parent has a higher rate than
the old parent.

While this often doesn't produce negative effects, it can affect components
in a voltage-scaling environment, like the GPU on the rk3399 socs, where the
voltage than simply is to low for the temporarily to high clock rate.

For general clock hirarchies this may need more extensive adaptions to
the common clock-framework, but at least for composite clocks having
both parent and rate settings it is easy to create a short-term solution to
make sure the clock-rate does not overflow the target.
----------- 8< ------------

But of course feel free to extend or change that as you wish ;-) .

I remember having clocks not overflow their target rate came up in some ELC 
talk last week (probably in Stephens Qualcomm-kernel-talk) and a general 
solution might need some changes closer to the core.

But at least for composite clocks where we can control the rate+parent 
process easily, Finley's change is a nice low-hanging fruit which at least 
improves behaviour for those clock-types in the short term, so
