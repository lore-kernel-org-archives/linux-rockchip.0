I visited Rockport this summer, guess I had it on the brain :)

I'd just like every controller that uses WAKE# to use the same name in
DT.  Maybe all that means for now is mentioning it in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt instead of (or in
addition to) Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/rockchip-pcie.txt
