HDMI infoframes are mandatory, so that's a big no-no.

For SPD, It's really not clear to me why atomic_check should do that in
the first place. Your initial concern was about exposing infoframes in
debugfs that wouldn't be used by the driver.

If the driver doesn't register a debugfs file for SPD, and ignores
whatever is in the atomic state, what's should we force drivers to do
that?
