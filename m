That's the fun part of this scenario - the presence of a card is 
unambiguous, it's only the absence of one which depends on the pull-up 
state, so whenever as a card is inserted everything does work correctly. 
  Assuming they are the same errors I was seeing, they're from the 
driver *thinking* a card is inserted due to CD floating low, then 
failing to communicate with it, after which it powers down the I/O 
interface again and the whole cycle begins anew.

No, it's a valid description of the hardware to say "disabling this 
regulator makes something fail to work as expected" if that is truly the 
case. Besides, pwrseq is about how to initialise a detected present 
card, not how to correctly detect that presence in the first place.

Great - there is of course still the possibility that the pin really 
isn't wired up at all, in which case ignoring CD and taking the CPU 
overhead of polling would be the only option, but the vendor DT doesn't 
have any signs to suggest that's the case, and makes me lean more 
towards the pull-up issue.

Robin.
