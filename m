I deed, I was supposed to think the same. but the vendor kernel dts
from firefly do follow the pwm2 pinctrl [1]. I wouldn't find any
information other than this vensor information, ie one of the reason I
have marked "Levin Du" who initially supported this board.

One, think I have seen was this pinctrl active fixed the boot hang.
any inputs from would be very helpful.

Levin Du, any inputs?
