I see that this is probably a bug on its own, which should be fixed on
its own (e.g., with the $subject patch), but FYI I was also pointed at
this patch, which also "resolves" this problem by fixing the rt5514 DAI
setup:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10067725/
[PATCH] ASoC: rockchip: Use dummy_dai for rt5514 dsp dailink

Would be nice to see it get handled too, possibly in 4.15 as well (I
think that's a regression too?).
