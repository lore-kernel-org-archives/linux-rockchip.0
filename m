Is it not that the denominator must be bigger than 20 times the
numerator?  That's what we found, although it seems that the greater the
divisor the better, so our aim is dividing down from 594MHz from GPLL to
the target rate in i2s_frac.

No, I hadn't looked at doing that.  I'm not sure how that would work,
we'd need to add support for fractional divider changing the parent rate
wouldn't we?

We're not setting the fractional rate specifically, instead we're
setting the i2s_pre rate and parent explicitly and banning the i2s_src
mux setting to i2s_pre, which means that clk_set_rate on sclk_i2s0 will
always change i2s_frac but leave i2s_pre alone.
