Sorry， I realized that it's not better to touch core dwc3 in a specific 
glue layer.
I touched dwc3 in glue layer, because I want to support dual-role mode， and
according to our dwc3 IP and usb3 PHY IP design， it need to reinit dwc3 
core
whenever  usb cable attached.

Anyway, it's wrong to do that.:-[

Why I need  dwc3_phy_setup in  glue layer is because usb3 IP design
in rockchip platform. If dwc3 works on host mode, it requires to put
dwc3 controller in reset state before usb3 phy initializing，and after
deassert reset,  we need to reconfigure UTMI+ PHY interface because
our dwc3 core can't configure PHY interface correctly.

Thank you for give me a chance to explain it.:-)

Ah, thanks very much for your kind explanation. I think I just only need
to add a compatible to dwc3-of-simple.c，for now， and I have tested
my dwc3， it worked well on peripheral only mode and host only mode
without PM. Further, if dwc3-of-simple.c adds generic handling of dual-role
and PM, I can improve our dwc3 feature.:-)
