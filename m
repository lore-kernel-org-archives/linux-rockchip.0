Yes several issues got fixed over past few years. If you find issues
please let me know, otherwise I can't help.

Well typically the wakeirq needs to be disabled during runtime like we
do for the generic wakeirqs. It might be connected to the RX line for
example so it's just noise during runtime. If you actually need it during
runtime then it's a separate story but I doubt that's the case here.

Talking of GPIO interrupt triggering, I wonder if something like below
might help? It seems we're missing the setting of triggering, see below.

Certainly all these issues need to be fixed if we intent to use it. Funny
how I have not run into these with my test cases. Do you have a GPIO
irqchip on I2C for handling the wake-up interrupts?

Tony
