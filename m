Right.  I was saying that not only are all lines within a given SoC
similar in terms of delay, but I was suggesting that perhaps the
internal delay for rk3188, rk3288, rk3228, ... is probably fairly
similar.  That's only a guess, though.

I have less faith than you in the TRM.  The TRM is full of minor
errors and is often wrong about the default state of things.  IMHO the
only true way to find out is to boot up some SoCs and check.

As far as whether code touches these values:

* I'm 100% certain that the kernel on rk3288 I tested doesn't touch.

* I'm 100% certain that the kernel on rk3399 I tested doesn't touch.

* I'm 95% certain that the BIOS (coreboot/depthcharge) on rk3288 I
tested doesn't touch.

* I'm 95% certain that the BIOS (coreboot/depthcharge) on rk3399 I
tested doesn't touch.  Note that the TRM on rk3399 does say 180
degrees is the default, but I believe you have also verified that it
comes up as 270.  Have you found any reason for this?


Also note that I look at V1.1 of the rk3288 TRM in the CRU section and =
I see:

* CRU_SDMMC_CON0: drive degree defaults to 0x1
* CRU_SDIO0_CON0: drive degree defaults to 0x1
* CRU_SDIO1_CON0: drive degree defaults to 0x1
* CRU_EMMC_CON0: drive degree defaults to 0x1

That actually means that they default to 90.  Of course you can also
see that the TRM is probably flawed because it claims that all the
bits here are "WO" (write only).  They are clearly not.

The TRM is also internally inconsistent.  When I then go into the
Mobile Storage Host section (Variable Delay/Clock Generation), I see
that it does in fact claim that the default is 180.

I'm OK with using 180 always as long as SD cards continue to work OK.
Best would be if someone could actually run a protocol analyzer for
all the different speed modes.

Hardcoding in this case is much better than putting in a device tree
binding.  I'm nearly certain that having a device tree binding that
doesn't account for different clock rates / speed modes is not a good
idea, and device tree bindings are supposed to be "set in stone".
Let's just hardcode it for now.

I can post up a CL.

You probably have the right TRMs.  The TRMs are just not accurate.  ;)
