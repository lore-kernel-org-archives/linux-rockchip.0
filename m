correct, use both but also update the binding, like 
mmc/rockchip-dw-mshc.txt does.

what I actually meant was that the driver could also recognize the rk3188-
timer compatible as "we need a clocksource" and it shouldn't matter which 
timer actually gets used for this.

Only devicetree people can really tell you if that is ok :-) .

The devicetree is supposed to be a hardware-description and implementation-
independent, so rockchip,clocksource sounds pretty much like linux-specific 
configuration things leaking into the devicetree.
