Hi,

Would like to add some "Tested-by:" tags.
Is Rockchip or someone with RK3066 hardware able to test this patch
with a HDMI TV or DVI monitor and give a report?

Power domain doesn't seem to turn off the vop and hdmi in v5.0-rc8.
The bug is due to a patch revert earlier this year.
To shutdown MK808 one can continue to use the patch at the link below until this
issue is fixed by them.
