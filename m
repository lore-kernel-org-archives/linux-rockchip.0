Hi Shunqian,

Sorry for delay in reply, I was on Holidays..

Thanks for testing.

Yes, this should have been something like this
-       if (pos > nvmem->size)
+       if (pos >= nvmem->size)
                 return 0;

We can send a fix on top of v9 once its merged.

May be you should use regmap_init_mmio_clk() instead of 
regmap_init_mmio() it will take care of clks.

yes, Am waiting for the framework to be merged, I have plans to add this 
feature.
