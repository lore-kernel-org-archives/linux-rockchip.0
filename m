I don't know what is the real meaning of "persistent". :)
I don't know should we count auto bkops as the persistent
registers....HS_TIMING and BUS_WIDTH should also be persistent
registers as them are always used after initialization if not changing
them?

IHMO the more reasonable way is that:
IIRC many settings for  EXT_CSD should be OTP, like hw-reset(162),
reliable write(167) fw-configure(169)..etc, which are marked as R/W.
These should be controlled by userpace or even by firmware when
flashing emmc, like reliable write...


I'm not sure whether should I updete this $SUBJUCT or migirating it to
userspace... We need to come to an agreement :)
