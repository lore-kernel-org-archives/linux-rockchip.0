I tried today but something has changed in mainline Linux and the
rk3288 isn't waking up from USB even when I've configured it
correctly.  I can still send up the patches, but they won't actually
produce something that will work upstream.  :(

I'll keep it my back burner to investigate, though if someone else
(like maybe someone from Rockchip) wanted to, they could to it too...

...until we figure out what's going on we should probably consider
these patches abandoned.
