What do you think if we separate two concepts here:

- amend mode: works like cursor updates, i.e, update the hw state at
some point with the latest state from the last call to async_update. No
special hardware support is required.

- async update: update hw state immediately. This depends if the hw
supports it or not.

Every async update is an amend, but the opposite is not necessarily true.

What do you think if we rename the current async_update to amend_update,
and we add a parameter "force_async" to it? (or maybe
force_immediate_update?)
Then amend_check with force_async=1 would fail if the hardware doesn't
support it (we could also add flags in the capabilities to inform
userspace the expected behaviour of things and if the hw supports
force_sync).

Like this, we can implement the cursors using the amend_update (which is
now called async_update), and async_flips with amend_update with
force_async=1.

If this sounds a reasonable proposal I can try to work on a prof of
concept. What do you think? Let me know if you have any other ideas.

Thanks,
Helen
