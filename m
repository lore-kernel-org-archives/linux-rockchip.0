I suggest to add

	As the driver doesn't provide a .get_state() callback it is
	expected that this changes behaviour slightly as pwm_get_state()
	will yield the last set instead of the last implemented setting.

to the commit log to fix this.

I don't expect any real breakage. The changed behaviour only affects
users of pwm_get_state() that is called after pwm_apply_state(). =

So for drivers/regulator/pwm-regulator.c this affects the .get_voltage()
call only. Note that .set_voltage() does call pwm_get_state() but
doesn't use the result. I don't see how my change would affect the
configuration written to the PWM registers when the PWM regulator driver
is its user. So if you want to convince me that the PWM regulator is one
of the potentially affected consumers, you have to work a bit harder.

I don't see how it would totally break even if the untested .get_state()
returns bogus values.
