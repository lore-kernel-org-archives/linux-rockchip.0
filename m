I don't want to power on the vdd_gpu and pd_gpu during the system 
suspend sequence.
I hope the pd_gpu and vdd_gpu power on/off just by gpu device.

I don't want to power off the vdd_gpu and pd_gpu during the system 
suspend sequence.
Because before the system suspend,the vdd_gpu and pd_gpu has been power 
off by gpu device(pm_ruantime_put).
