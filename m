I don't think this approach is entirely sound either.

From the side of the PCI device, WAKE# is just a GPIO line, and how it
is wired into the system is an entirely separate matter. So I don't
think it is justified to overload the notion of legacy interrupts with
some other pin that may behave in a way that is vaguely similar to how
a true wake-up capable interrupt works.

So I'd argue that we should add an optional 'wake-gpio' DT property
instead to the generic PCI device binding, and leave the interrupt
binding and discovery alone.
