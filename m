Yes I know, my point was that the reset-gpios property should be used
instead of a fake regulator if what's needed is to toggle a chip pin.

I think each change has to be justified on its own so I would say that
having a regulator enabled as a part of a SDIO chip's power sequencing
is something needed for many platforms, and that this provider should
be extended to support that (something like commit msg in patch 05/12).

And then in the kylin DTS change (patch 08/12), I would explain why a
chained regulators approach is used/needed instead of the reset-gpios
due any platform limitations.
