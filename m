The usual advice would be for 4990d4fe327b ("PM / Wakeirq: Add automated
device wake IRQ handling") to use SRCU rather than RCU.  Is there some
reason that won't work?

And yes, my commit 5b72f9643b52a ("rcu: Complain if blocking in
preemptible RCU read-side critical section") that is now in -tip needs
adjustment for -rt.  I can easily add "&& IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT)"
or whatever the current incantation is.  Just let me know!

							Thanx, Paul
