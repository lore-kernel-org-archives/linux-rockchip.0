Now I remember why I retired my evb ... ES1 silicon.

Anyway, I was able to describe the rk808 pmic that is used in some basic way 
and was able to see a bit of cpu-scaling on the little cluster, but the big 
cluster never was able to scale in a stable way and always hung the system.

I don't think that we should care about ES1 chips as they never reached any 
public but that leaves me without the ability to test.

In another issue I read that Caesar also is using a rk3399evb sometimes, so 
maybe he can give that a try on real ES2 silicon and I've thus Cc'ed him.

@Caesar I don't know how much the power rails differ between evb versions, so 
maybe you can also provide the necessary rk808 devicetree nodes please?


Thanks
Heiko
