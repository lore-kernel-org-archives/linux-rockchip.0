What would you suggest as a valid range, then?

From the public Arasan datasheet they seem to indicate +/- 15 MHz is
sane.  Does that sound OK?  Presuming that all of your numbers
(50/100/150/200) are centers, that means that we could support clock
rates of:

35 MHz - 65 MHz
85 MHz - 115 MHz
135 MHz - 165 MHz
185 MHz - 200 MHz


So how about if we add a warning for things that are outside of those
ranges?  ...except no warning for < 35 MHz since presumably we're not
using high speed modes when the DLL is that slow and so we're OK.


NOTE: In rk3399 it's actually quite important to handle clocks that
aren't exactly the right MHz.  When you ask for 150 MHz you actually
end up a child of GPLL and actually end up at 148.5 MHz.  This should
be close enough, but it's not exactly 150 MHz.  If we can't handle
148.5 MHz then the 150 MHz setting in the PHY is useless.

Also note that on rk3399 we're fairly limited on the number of rates
we can actually make since they need to be even divisors of 594 MHz or
800 MHz (assuming you don't rejigger all the PLLs in the SoC or
something).  Most of the rates are actually in those ranges...
