Sure, I can split those changes.

I'll fix the indentation.

Okay.

Yes, if we keep the current duty_cycle it can exceed the period value.
I'm fine dropping the ->duty_cycle = 0 assignment and documenting the
behavior.

Sure.

Agreed.

I'll go for this one.

Okay.

Absolutely. I'll fix that.

Nope, I'll switch to duty_cycle.

I'm fine returning -EINVAL in this case.

Thanks for rewording some of my sentences and reviewing the patch.
