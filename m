Agree, It is, let me explain :)

Ideally we shouldn't have this check, to get rid of this check I only need the
offsets for bvalid_session register for all the compatibles and fill in phy
configuration data (rk3228_phy_cfgs, &rk3328_phy_cfgs, rk3366_phy_cfgs,
rv1108_phy_cfgs)

To be honest I didn't look if all the datasheets are public available, let me do
some research. Or, if anyone has the datasheet and can tell where the
bvalid_session bit is I can fill all the data.

Best regards,
 Enric
