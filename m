Since support for BURST needs to be from peripheral too, we should have
that as a property for peripheral not for controller.

The peripheral drivers can communicate the burst to be used to pl330
using src_maxburst/dst_maxburst in dma_slave_config. We can use this
value to indicate the DMA should be single (a value of 0) or burst with
"burst" value.
