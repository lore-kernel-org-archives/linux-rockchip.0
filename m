Coreboot certainly has support for this.  It assigns the UUID based on
the disk it gets the kernel for.  If you read my email, you'll see
that it only has a problem when doing TFTP boot.  In this case it
doesn't know which disk to use for a UUID.

See my other email.  ...and yes, if there is no sane ordering then
you've just got to deal.  ...but there is a sane ordering on many
embedded devices.  If you've got a car and you need to get there fast,
you take the car.  It doesn't matter if other people are biking or
walking.

Not saying UUIDs don't solve problems.  I'm just saying that assigning
consistent numbering shouldn't be hurting you.

Right.  UUIDs are great.  ...but still seeing nothing that says that
assigning consistent numbering hurts you or hurts UUIDs.
