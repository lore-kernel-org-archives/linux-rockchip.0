What advantage does that bring?

Again, I simply don't understand what advantage does the aproach you are 
trying to use bring.

HID over I2C is a generic protocol. Sure, we need to have quirks for 
device-specific bugs, and in such cases enumerate particular devices. But 
we don't need DT for that at all.
