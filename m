do you have some sort of merge plan for this or are you waiting for
specific Acks? I guess if we're waiting for an Ack from Mark Brown,
we'll need a resend of the patch.

All other patches have Acks from their subsystem maintainers (rtc, clk)
so you could pick up all patches except patch3 and I could just resend
this one, which in turn could also go through the regulator tree.

Otherwise we'll probably need a resend of the series, as Mark most of
the time doesn't keep old patch series around.
