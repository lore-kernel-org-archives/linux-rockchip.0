The APIs regulator_count_voltages() and regulator_list_voltage(), are
currently used from the mmc core to find out which voltages that is
supported (with 0.1V granularity). Then that information can be used
when trying to set a new voltage.

But I guess such a wrapper API is out of the question?

Anyway, I get the feeling that we will need to do the same for this case.

I am not sure I follow here. In the regulator_set_voltage_tol() you
can only specifiy one limit (tolerance?). What Dough proposed was to
add a new API which can have both a low tolerance value and a high
tolerance value.

Kind regards
