The supply is actually named the same on both boards, so you could move
all the usb-nodes to the main dtsi, including the reference to vcc5v0_host
which would then get defined itself in the two board dts.

Then again, seeing that the vcc5v0_host also only differs in the actually
used gpio another option would be to move the whole regulator node
to the dtsi and just define the gpio properties in the board dts files.
