Most of functions and registers of the rk817 and rk808 are the same,
so they can share allmost all codes.

Their specifications are as follows£º
  1) The RK809 and RK809 consist of 5 DCDCs, 9 LDOs and have the same registers
     for these components except dcdc5.
  2) The dcdc5 is a boost dcdc for RK817 and is a buck for RK809.
  3) The RK817 has one switch but The Rk809 has two.

Changes in V2:
1. initialize the pm_pwroff_fn to NULL. 
2. use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL to export pm_power_off_prepare.
3. change patch 2/3/4/5 subjects. 

Changes in V3£º
1. change patch 4 subjects
2. replace pr_ with dev_ for printing in patch 2
3. modify switch1 and switch2 configs in patch 2
4. explain gpio information for rk809 and rk817 in patch 4

Changes in V4:
1. modify some codes for patch 2 and patch 5 according to comments 
2. add reviewer mail lists for patch 3 and 4

Changes in V5:
modify some codes for patch 1 according to reveiw comments for v3.
 1) remove the pm_power_off_prepare() and replace with shutdown call-back from syscore
 2) move the macro REGMAP_IRQ_M into the regmap.h and rename it REGMAP_IRQ_LINE
 3) make some dev_warn() log clear
