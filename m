In my pov, async updates holds the properties of an amend update, so all
async updates we have are amend, but the opposite is not true.

I kinda did this (I re-introduced async in the last patch in the
series). I know this order is confusing, but as rockchip doesn't
implement true async, I would have to do a bunch of modifs at once to
keep the commits consistent, but I can re-work on that if it makes
things clearer.

users could combine NONBLOCK flag with PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC, no? (we need to
add code for it of course).
