Well, the question is: Is this MXM3 interface as generic as Qseven so
that it could be used as is for other modules (and baseboards from othe=
r
manufacturers could be used for the module)? Then my thought was
landingship as identifier for the baseboard and geekbox as identifier
for the contained module.

I agree that if this Landingship is specific to the GeekBox then
geekbox-landingship would be more appropriate. We could also do both.

Can you tell? Unfortunately I spot no real documentation of the MXM3
connector pins in the schematics we could compare, only an on-board
documentation of the three-row pins.

Regards,
Andreas
