I think I managed to get a fairly good idea of what's going on here.

Firstly, the modes are still being validated against rockchip_mpll_cfg 
in dw_hdmi_rockchip_mode_valid() - I'm slightly suspicious of that given 
the implication that the HDMI TX block takes a clock from the external 
phy in this case, but I don't know the details of the DesignWare IP 
either way, and the clock tree is also absent from the public RK3328 
TRM, so I'm only guessing.

Modes that don't find an appropriate rate in dw_hdmi (e.g. 1024x768) get 
thrown out there and then and that's that. Otherwise, things then depend 
on the clock setting in the phy driver - when all the stars line up and 
there is a matching rate there too (e.g. 1080p or 800x600@60), the phy 
clock gets set correctly and everything works; when there is no 
appropriate phy rate (e.g. 1280x1024), inno_hdmi_phy_clk_round_rate() 
fails such that inno_hdmi_phy_rk3328_clk_set_rate() never even gets 
called - that would seem to explain the vblank timeouts, if the hardware 
ends up unclocked but someone somewhere along the line doesn't realise.

Robin.
