This patch is a part of the patchset, which in result removes enum at all,
so there will be no definition conflict.

AFAIU, DTS files are not a part of ABI.

I understand that enums are better than macros for some reasons.
However, I think it is dangerous to use duplicate definitions in
different places when values of these definitions use in the same
code.
So, given that the enum cannot be used in DT, I left only macros.

You personally wrote that the enum pwm_polarity can change, so the
desynchronization I quite possible.
