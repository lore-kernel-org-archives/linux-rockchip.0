Russell,

How does this case differ form defining a 'stdout-path' in the chosen
node of the device-tree [1] purposed to provide a path to the boot
console device among multiple UART's a board may have.

Again, I'm merely trying to overcome the fact that on one of my IMX6
boards usdhc2 registers as 'mmcblk0' and is an SDIO radio while usdhc3
registers as 'mmcblk1' and is the only 'bootable' device. I'm not all
that familiar with SDIO drivers... perhaps its completely wrong that
the IMX6 MMC driver is registering usdhc2 as a 'block device'?
