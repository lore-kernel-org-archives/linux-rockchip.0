I don't have any set opinion right now but after looking through the
other uses of the sbs-battery the cros-ec-sbs.dtsi snippet really seems
somewhat veyron/gru-specific - especially wrt. the retry-count values.

What I'm not sure about is whether it is actually better to keep the include
around under a new name or just move the (rather tiny) sbs-battery node
into the relevant devicetrees directly, when there aren't that many users
anyway.
