I'm not sure what change you're proposing :-) .

I currently see the reg-property both in the dts and in the code as
"offset" - the start-register, because it points to uoc_con0 for each phy.
So if needed I was just planning on doing reg+x , as they're coming from
the GRF anyway.

One interesting point would be to move that under the GRF node, similar
to what we're doing with the power-domains under the PMU.

In retrospect I think exposing the phys individually was not the best
decision - especially as when you dive deeper, they are not that similar
anymore and individual functions change. But we'll have to live with that.

That is by the way, also one of the reasons for having these per-phy
structs, so that we have the possility to identify phys again and describe
individual phy-functions but still keep the current binding.
The usb-uart is the first user for that :-)
