I've tested these two patches together with the dw_mmc one and everything 
that worked before still works (tuning on veyron-jerry) and everything that 
didn't work still doesn't work (tuning on firefly [likely a regulator issue]).

And re-checking the code against the TRM I now also see the mask that is to 
short (1 bit in the code vs. the actual 2 bits described in the manual)

I'm still trying to make up my mind on how to proceed - aka in which order 
patches should get picked up.

Going with the "if it isn't upstream it doesn't exist" mantra Rob wrote 
somewhere some days ago, taking this revert should not hurt anything, as all 
the non-veyron devices currently don't support any tuning at all.

So I'd think except for the issue Shawn was originally trying to fix (for 
some non-mainline board?) it should be possible to take this patch any time 
independently of the dw_mmc part.

If Stephen or Mike want to do this directly, this is
