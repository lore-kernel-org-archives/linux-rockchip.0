I agree that this matches what's downstream and seems right.

As you pointed out the bindings are a bit on the sketchy side,
claiming a certain length in one place but then saying that the length
depends on the HW version in another place.  I'll also point out that
the bindings are inconsistent about the name that should be used.
AKA:

marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-2g
 -vs-
marvell,caldata_00_txpwrlimit_2g_cfg_set

...but I think the answer is that it doesn't matter at all from a
practical point of view.  The code seems to just find everything that
starts with "marvell,caldata" and send the binary blindly to the WiFi
card.  Presumably there is enough of a header in the opaque binary
data that the card can make sense of what it's being sent.


So it seems like this is the best we can do given the current state of
the world.
