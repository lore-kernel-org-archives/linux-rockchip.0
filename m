Can you point at where the TRM says that the default state is high active?

With the manual I have, I look at TSADC_AUTO_CON and I look at the
description of "Bit 8".  It says that "tshut polarity" is 0 for low
active and 1 for high active.  It then said that the Reset Value is 0.

...the "Reset Value" in tables like this is notoriously unreliable, so
I can totally believe that it's wrong.  If you can point me at the
part of the TRM that says that TSHUT is high active by default then I
can confirm that for you.  ;)
