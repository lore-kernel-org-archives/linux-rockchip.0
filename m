The alleged purpose wasn't just for the delay (it wasn't even mentioned
in v1), but in case there are ever devices with multiple regulators and
different power sequencing (?) I guess. I still don't see why Rob
thought it needed a separate compatible property.

About the delay: as noted in my reply to patch 1, this was actually a
property of the device/firmware -- it needs some time to initialize
before we can talk to it. I previously had included that delay in the
regulator ramp delay, but since we'd know the device info here, I found
it convenient to latch onto the same property.

IOW, typically, if you have a device-specific compatible property, it
makes sense to key device-specific info off of that property where
possible. But if (like you suggest) the compatible property is
counter-productive, then we would need a separate property for this
delay.

Fine with me, if Rob is OK. I replid on 1/2.
