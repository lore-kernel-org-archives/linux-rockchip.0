The patch

   SoC: rockchip-max98090: Remove MICBIAS as supply of input pin IN34

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.4

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] SoC: rockchip-max98090: Remove MICBIAS as supply of input pin
 IN34

Commit ec0d23b295b9 ("ASoC: rockchip-max98090: Fix the Headset Mic
route.") moved the MICBIAS widget to supply Headset Mic but forget to
remove the MICBIAS widget to supply IN34 which is not really needed, so
remove that path so we have:

   IN34 <==== Headset MIC <==== MICBIAS
