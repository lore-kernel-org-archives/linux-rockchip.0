Patch 2/2 is a pinctrl change, that actually depends in this patch.
Improved clock-handling in the pinctrl driver caused the pd_pmu clock t=
o get=20
deactivated.

So, perhaps it might be even better to get an Ack from the clock mainta=
iner=20
and merge both patches through the pinctrl tree?


In which case Linus Walleij should also be included as recipient of thi=
s patch=20
when resending.
