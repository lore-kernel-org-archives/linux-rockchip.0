We introduced soc-ctl-syscon to do several things, for instance, update
baseclk or update clkmul, etc. In odrder to access this physical block,
we need to explicitly enable its clock. Currently we don't control this
clock as we always add a CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag for it to indicate that
we will not gate it even if not referenced. This is not a correct way since
it is a clock parenting from clk_ahb which is used by sdhci-of-arasan now.
Without enabling clk_ahb, the flag don't guarantee we could access
soc-ctl-syscon. Moreover, we can't find a reason not to gate clk_syscon
once we remove/power-down emmc controller. So let's add clk_syscon and
enable/disable it explicitly when needed.
