Understood.

Is the memory space issue actually a problem? I don't see anything in
the spec that says how these should behave when the device is off.

(I mean, it's always nice if there are fewer ways to crash the system.
But I thought mem 0xffffffff was only a convention, not a standard.)

I've been bugging Shawn about this for a while already. It's not clear
there's really a good solution so far, apart from hacking the arch
exception handlers, like you're doing in the imx6 driver:

commit 415b6185c541dc0a21457ff307cdb61950a6eb9f

    PCI: imx6: Fix config read timeout handling

I don't think the ARM64 maintainers have been fond of adding similar
"hook" code...

Fine with me.
