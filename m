I just gave that a try again on my pinky-rev2. And while the tsadc did produce 
some results and didn't hang the system in my tries, the temperature values 
seemed to be frozen (only changing once on every reboot).

Running the same kernel on a Jerry produced the expected results of the 
temperature changing over time and differing cpu frequencies.

Pinky also is a sort of dinosaur and only you and me seem to still like them 
:-) . And something is definitly strange here, and I'd tend to keep the tsadc 
disabled for the time being.
