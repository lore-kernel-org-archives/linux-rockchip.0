From what I can gather online:

"For RV1126/RV1109 and RK356X platforms, VICAP and ISP are two independent image processing IPs,
If the image collected by VICAP is to be processed by ISP , it is necessary to generate v4l2
corresponding to the interface of VICAP at the driver level sub The device is linked to the node
corresponding to the ISP to provide parameters for the ISP driver to use."

"For the RK356X chip, VICAP has only a single core and has both dvp/mipi interfaces. The dvp interface
corresponds to a rkvicap_dvp node, and the mipi interface corresponds to a rkvicap_mipi_lvds node each
node can be collected independently."

"In order to synchronize the VICAP collected data information to the isp driver, it is necessary to link the
logical sditf node generated by the VICAP driver to the virtual node
device generated by the isp"

In a graph showing how ISP and VICAP are connected a virtual connection
is used (as opposed to a Entitative connection, e.g., between the mipi
sensor and the csi2 dphy)

So from my understanding, VICAP/ISP2.1 of rk3568 seem to be different from the rk3588,
where the VICAP is clearly connected to the two ISP3.0
