Yes happy to wait for ACK from Rob. Of the 3 patches done this is the 
least urgent, as Bluetooth is currently non functioning on these 
machines, so delay in this doesn't change the status quo. Patch 3 is 
self standing, e.g. not applying it doesn't affect the other two. 
However patch 3 probably has to be applied sequentially after patches 
1&2 as all are on the single file.

Following on from Robs comments on last patch sent adding bluetooth, 
I've made this one FAR more detailed. That said though the drivers for 
bluetooth in this case doesn't use clock or supply ASAIK. Most things 
are brought up by the wifi part of the device tree which was patch 2. 
However adding to the bluetooth device tree as well, at least leaves the 
option open to a user just loading bluetooth, and not wifi.

The one thing missing from this bluetooth device tree, is explaining 
which pins need to be pulled to bring up the card. This is part be 
design (the tinker board and rt8723bs both have bad public documentation 
- so exact operation is hard to guess ...); but also because I couldn't 
see a way of getting a SerDev device to pull pins on loading, unlike 
sdio (used for wifi).

Full series:

Part 1 - device tree changes for sd card
Part 2 - adding wifi to the device tree
Part 3 - adding outline bluetooth

So are each fairly self standing. However if interested in parts 1 and 2 
they can be found:

Regards, and yes happy to wait and see what Rob has to say.

David.
