We need to add regulators to the CPU nodes, so cpufreq doesn't think it
can crank up the clock speed without changing the voltage. However, we
don't yet have the DT bindings to fully describe the Over Voltage
Protection (OVP) circuits on these boards. Without that description, we
might end up changing the voltage too much, too fast.

Add the pwm-regulator descriptions and associate the CPU OPPs, but leave
them disabled.
