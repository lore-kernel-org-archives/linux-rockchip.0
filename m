Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: remove disable-wp from rv1108-elgin-r1 emmc node

List-Id: linux-rockchip.vger.kernel.org

The mmc.txt didn't explicitly say disable-wp is for SD card slot only,
but that is what it was designed for in the first place.
Remove all disable-wp from emmc or sdio controllers.
