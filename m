No, not really. As discussed in later versions of this thread already,
the WAKE# hierarchy is orthogonal to the PCI hierarchy, and I think we
settled that it's reasonable to just consider this as a 1-per-device
thing, with each device "directly" attached to the PM controller. While
sharing could happen, that's something we decided to punt on...didn't
we?

I'm not completely sure of the details, but I believe this *can* be
determined by PME. But I'm not sure it's guaranteed to be supported,
especially in cases where we already have 1:1 WAKE#. So we should be
*trying* to report this wakeirq info from the device, if possible.
