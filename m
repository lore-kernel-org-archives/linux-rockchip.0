You can have a look at=20
https://git.linaro.org/people/srinivas.kandagatla/linux.git/blob/b4c3ad=
253747767511233687436f20144e850d67:/drivers/nvmem/rockchip-efuse.c

I did modify the rockchip driver, which I guess should be very much=20
similar to what OCOTP driver would need.

We already have that in place.

There are no limitaions as such from nvmem framework, regmap might have=
=20
limitations w.r.t to sleeping and fast_io, as fast_io would take=20
spinlocks, AFAIK the providers would not have fast_io, as they not IO=20
devices.

Yes, if you pass read-only flag in the provider, the framework would no=
t=20
attempt to even write.

You will find answers to most of your question in the rochip-efuse.c fi=
le.
