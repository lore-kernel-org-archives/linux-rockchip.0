I'd say that they _aren't_ in conflict with it - or are you saying
that the I2S driver was never functionally tested as working?

I also would not think that it's platform specific - remember that
this is Designware IP, and it's likely that other platforms with
exactly the same IP would suffer from the same problem.  It's
probably revision specific, but we need Synopsis' input on that.

However, I do believe that your patch probably doesn't have much
merit in any case: on a mode set, you enable the audio clock, and
it will remain enabled until the audio device is first opened and
then closed.  If another mode set comes along, then exactly the
same situation happens again.  So, really it isn't achieving all
that much.
