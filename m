This is the wrong approach, as runtime suspend is prevented by the PM
core in this phase. More precisely, it does a
pm_runtime_get_noresume() in the device prepare phase.

I think it seems like you would benefit from using the so called the
runtime PM centric approach, which gives you system PM support for
"free". Please have a look at the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume()
helpers.

Seems like there is also a missing configuration of the relationship
between the PM domains. In the genpd terminology, you probably want to
set pd_gpu as a subdomain of the vdd_gpu.

In that way, the vdd_gpu is always powered on before pd_gpu is powered
on. And vice verse when powering off.

Please see my comment above.
