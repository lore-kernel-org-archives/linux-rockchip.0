Setting the bus is correct, then it needs to be registered with the
driver core so the bus link shows up (and a driver is bound to it.)
That is when the bus notifier can happen, right?

What is a "bridge chain"?

But aren't you just the driver for the "partner device"?

If not, why isn't a real device being created that you then bind to,
what "fake" type of thing are you attempting to do here that would
require you to do this out-of-band?

What operations?  What exactly is delayed?  You should not be touching a
device before you have it on your bus, right?

If you somehow convince me that the existing bus notifiers will not
work, yes :)

No, do it properly like any other function call to another subsystem.

Don't do "select" if at all possible, always try to do "depends on".
