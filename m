I'm not fully convinced either, more like "let's see". In that narrow
sense, ack. I don't see harm in trying, if you're also open to backing
off in case it does not pan out.

At least for display, where this also depends on peripheral hardware,
it's not an easy problem, really. How reliable do you need it to be?
How many nines? Who is going to debug the issues that need hundreds or
thousands of runs to reproduce? If a commit makes some test less
reliable, how long is it going to take to even see that or pinpoint
that?

It's a kind of cop out, but this is not filesystems. In many cases I
think we might be able to make things more robust by failing faster and
failing more, but the users probably want us to plunge forward despite
some errors to try to get something on screen.

(Come to think of it, perhaps we should classify tests based on whether
external hardware plays a role.)

So I'm not so concerned about the filter lists per se, but rather about
having them in kernel.

BR,
Jani.
