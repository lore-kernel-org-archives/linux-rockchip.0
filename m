We're now into the 4.5 timeframe.  Does anyone have a concrete set of
things that need to happen before this patch series makes it into
mainline?

=46rom searching I see that the latest version of this series is v4 and
there are a smattering of comments on the 24-patch series.  Presumably
a v5 needs to be posted to address those things.

=2E..but it looks like the big sticking point is that Boris is waiting
for a response to his questions in
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7622881/>.  Thierry: can you give
Boris some direction for what else he needs to do?  We need to come up
with _some_ solution since this series gets us much better support for
PWM regulators.  Without this series or some other solution, PWM
regulators aren't usable in mainline on any system that uses them for
system-critical rails.  Nearly all Rockchip reference boards and
shipping devices uses a PWM regulator for the system-critidal "logic"
rail.  That means any patches which need to change this rail in Linux
are blocked.

If there's already been off-list discussion and Boris already knows
what the next steps are then my apologies and I'll wait patiently for
the next series.  ;)

Thanks!

-Doug
