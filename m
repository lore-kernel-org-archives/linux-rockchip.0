Well - there is still lots of duplicated code there, which may mean
duplicate bugs to fix, that's not ideal at all. It would be great if
we manage to separate common code and glue code (you call it "flow"
which I have no idea what it refers to) around it.

I will review this patch anyway but this driver and cadence's are pretty
much indentical, there is not much doubt about that.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
