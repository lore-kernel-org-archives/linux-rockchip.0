Yes, that's somewhat right. That is a problem that all approaches have
that allow to determine the result of a given request without actually
applying it. (Same for clk_round_rate() for example.) I think that it
won't be possible to map all use cases without such an approach however.

But the effect of the race can be minimised if I calculate a good
PWM state (which might not be optimal because of the race) and then use
pwm_apply_state_exact().

Having said that, we already have a very similar problem today. Each
driver that does clk_get_rate without installing a notifier for
frequency changes might suffer from unexpected results if another clk
consumer changes the given clk.

We're talking about different things here. I want that if you assembled
the same type of pwm-regulator to an imx machine and a rockchip machine
the representation of this regulator in the respective device trees
would look identical (apart from the handle to the PWM). Of course this
doesn't work for two different types of regulators.

The datasheet of the regulator for sure is also agnostic to the actual
PWM driving the input and provides a generic table or formula.

We're in agreement here. And as there are cases where a suitable
algorithm exists, we need some support in the PWM API to actually
implement these. pwm_round_state is the best I'm aware of as it is
powerful enough to map all requirements I currently think necessary and
still it is not too hard to implement the needed callback for the device
drivers.

Either I don't understand what you intend to say, or I fail to see its
relevance here. If the device tree specifies a PWM regulator with
continuous voltage mode the right thing to do with a request for a
certain voltage is to exactly calculate the needed PWM setting with the
parameters provided and rely on the PWM driver to implement what it
promises. If the PWM driver is buggy or the device tree representation
is inaccurate, well there is nothing the PWM framework or the
pwm-regulator driver can do about it.
