Currently this framework is used by atleast 3 drivers(qcom-tsens, 
qcom-cpr, begel-bone-cape manager) which are still floating in the 
mailing list.

I was hoping that these 3 users would getback with tested-by.. which did 
not happen for last 3-4 weeks.

I would appreciate, If you could try framework too, and let me know.

I added two of wrappers on top of v5 at: 
https://git.linaro.org/people/srinivas.kandagatla/linux.git/shortlog/refs/heads/nvmem-dev-v5


I think I should request Mark to take the framework.
