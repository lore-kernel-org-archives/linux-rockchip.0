Yes. And if there were other fields in that third cell, there'd be other
variables that would be derived from those.

These aren't useless 0 values. 0 doesn't mean "don't care", it's a very
specific value. In this case it implies that the polarity is "normal".
That's very useful if you have a PWM controller that can set the
polarity.

Some drivers already do this by supporting 2-cell and 3-cell specifiers.
Not everyone does this and they shouldn't need to. The bindings are very
clear about what to do with that third cell and how to parse it. It's
just a matter of reading and understanding the bindings. It's not
exactly rocket science, so why do we have to jump through hoops to try
and simplify it?

And then you have to go and and parsing code everywhere to deal with
these new flags. I prefer to have this parsing code in the core where
it's written once and used everywhere, instead of letting drivers deal
with flags that they might interpret wrongly.

Also remember that the third cell may be extended in the future and not
all data in in may end up being a simple flag.
