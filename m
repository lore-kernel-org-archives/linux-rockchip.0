  clk: rockchip: release io resource when failing to init clk on rk3399 (2016-06-03 15:36:49 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
A bunch of fixes. Some for the newly added rk3399 clock tree, some
concerning error handling and initialization and a revert of the
mmc-phase clock initialization, as this could conflict with the
bootloader setting of this clock and a real solution to initing
the phase correctly from dw_mmc went in as fix for 4.7 through
the mmc tree.
