NACK on this one.

After re-reading the v1 submission I realized Rob asked for this change,
but I strongly disagree.

HID over I2C is a generic protocol, in the same way HID over USB is. We
can not start adding device specifics here, this is opening the can of
worms. If the device is a HID one, nothing else should matter. The rest
(description of the device, name, etc...) is all provided by the
protocol.

Agree on this one however.
