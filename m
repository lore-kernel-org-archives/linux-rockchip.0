Yes, your suggestions seems like they would have made the code both (a
little) more straightforward and efficient. But...

...that check isn't valid as of patch 4, where Caesar adds handling for
intermediate steps. We really never should have been strictly snapping
to the 5C steps in the first place; intermediate values are OK.

So, we still need some kind of search to find the right step -- or
closest bracketing range, to compute the interpolated value. We should
only reject temperatures that are too high or too low for the ADC to
represent.


--- Side track ---

BTW, when we're considering rejecting temperatures here: shouldn't this
be fed back to the upper layers more nicely? We're improving the error
handling for this driver in this series, but it still leaves things
behaving a little odd. When I tested, I can do:

## set something obviously way too high
echo 700000 > trip_point_X_temp

and get a 0 (success) return code from the sysfs write() syscall, even
though the rockchip driver rejected it with -ERANGE. Is there really no
way to feed back thermal range limits of a sensor to the of-thermal
framework?
