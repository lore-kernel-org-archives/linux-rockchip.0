In this case, the exynos_g2d_drm.h seems like a good idea. As I'm
obviously biased, it's better to check how others feel on the topic.

Ouch the armsoc ddx... Last time I've checked it felt like a place
where everyone is doing his own thing, with no actual reviews and/or
maintainer. Iirc most/all of it's functionality was achievable with
modesetting ddx (with or without glamor) ? I take it that things have
changed and/or I misunderstood something ?

Note: The above is not meant as bashing although it hell sure looks lik=
e one.
