Better not do it as-is, the small fan is extremely noisy. That was the
benefit of the heartbeat mode, it was a poor man's pwm. I'll see what I
can do with the gpio-pwm. BTW, on all my MiQi, I have raised the critical
points to 90 degrees, one of my workplace build farm made of 4 MiQi, I
have connected a large slow fan which start to run above 85 degrees and
it's enough to prevent the critical point from ever being reached. The
dissipate heat is very low and the heatsink small so with minimal air
flow, the temperature drops very quickly.

Thanks,
Willy
