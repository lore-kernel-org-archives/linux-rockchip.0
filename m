Yes, this requirment is from dw_mmc databook(v270a), table 10-5.

But you can see that we didn't handle MMC_TIMING_UHS_SDR12.
As recommended, MMC_TIMING_UHS_SDR12 mode need to 50M here to make
the internal devider to be "1".
Because Figure 10-3 (Clock Structure for Host Controller) assumes Soc=20
only supplies 50M/100M/200M, these three frequency selection, to=20
cclk_in. So SDR12 should be 50M/2 =3D 25M. But for Rockchip Socs, we ha=
ve=20
RK3288_CLKGEN_DIV before cclk_in that means we don't follow this table.

=46or DDR52-8bit, it's a mandatory requirment to use 100M as cclk_in.

yes, see the comments blow.

Soc specific. But it's a trivial margin.

When running in DDR52-8bit, 2 cycle of cclk_in is used
for a single data bit internally. When shifting cclk_in_drv to 180,
we can see:

cclk_in    ____      ____      ____      ____      ___
	__|    |____|    |____|    |____|    |____|

cclk_in_drv-180
                 ____      ____      ____      ____      ___
	     __|    |____|    |____|    |____|    |____|

cclk_in_for_DDR52-8bit
            _________           _____
         __|         |_________|



So cclk_in_drv shifts 180 from cclk_in, which means it's just in the
90 degrees of cclk_in_for_DDR52-8bit. That is what I'd expect that when
running in DDR mode, the cclk_in_drv should be in the 90 degree of
*Actual Internal CLK*, not cclk_in always.

But fot SD DDR50-4bit, it just use cclk_in internlly, so 90 should
be okay.

So we were not in the same page of what the ref-clk is. But I think now
we are in.

Agree on all the calculation below.
