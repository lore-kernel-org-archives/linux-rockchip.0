I think wee need to clarify the meaning of the async_update callback
(and we should clarify it in the docs).

The way I understand what the async_update callback should do is: don't
block (i.e. don't wait for the next vblank), and update the hw state at
some point with the latest state from the last call to async_update.

Which means that: any driver can implement the async_update callback,
independently if it supports changing its state right away or not.
If hw supports, async_update can change the hw state right away, if not,
then changes will be applied in the next vblank (it can even amend the
pending commit if there is one).
With this, we can remove all the legacy cursor code to use the
async_update callback, since async_update can be called 100 times before
the next vblank, and the latest state will be set to the hw without
waiting 100 vblanks.

Please, let me know if this is your understanding as well. If not, then
we need to remodel things.

Thanks,
Helen
