as Viresh said, it should be ok to do it like your approach creating a =
module=20
in drivers/cpufreq. But the compatible check is necessary.

Doing it this way also makes it easier to have

Please always keep multiplatform in mind. These days the kernel can be=20
compiled for multiple architectures at the same time, so you can have s=
upport=20
for Rockchip, Exynos, Qualcom and whatever in the same kernel image.

Therefore a compile-time check is not enough and you need to check the=20
actually running machine as well.
