Ah, got it!

I guess I would be super surprised if an SoC implemented
register[15:8] but still then required you to manually copy that value
to corecfg_baseclkfreq.  Presumably nobody would be crazy enough to
try to measure the clock rate in the SDHCI driver, so this would
probably only be non-zero where the SDHCI clock is totally fixed.
...in that case probably the SoC designer would also put a default
value in corecfg_baseclkfreq that matched (and maybe even make
corecfg_baseclkfreq read-only?).

Even in the case that an SoC designer didn't put a value into
corecfg_baseclkfreq that matched register[15:8], it seems very likely
that the rate returned from the clk_get_rate() would match.

I guess what I'm saying is that, to me, it seems like my patch isn't
broken in any real systems.  If we ever find a system that needs this
behavior in the future, we can add it.  Until then, it seems like my
patch would be fine.  Do you agree?

Note: right now we only provide a register map for rk3399, so
certainly we can't be breaking any other SoCs with our current method.

It was presuming that there might be future callers who might want to
write other corecfg registers and might need to know whether the write
worked or not.  Since having the return value doesn't hurt anything
I'd rather leave it in.  If you really want me to remove it, though, I
will.  Just let me know.
