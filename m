Hi all,

This patch was send for the first time within these series [1], but
might have more sense sent alone as doesn't depends on the rest of
the series, so, remove from these series and send a second version
that can be applied independently.

Best regards,
Enric

Changes in v2:
- Split from the first version and send as a separate patch.
- Mention that the extcon provides the cable-state. (Heiko)
- Remove the introduced utmi-avalid documentation.
