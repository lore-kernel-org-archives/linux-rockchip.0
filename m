Fixing this issue also requires changes to drivers, so it would be
nice if you put those changes into the same patchset.
Otherwise someone may apply this series and expect things to work but
they will still be broken. Specifically the peripherals should be
setting their burst sizes for their DMA requests low enough to avoid
needing the working DMAFLUSHP instruction.

Also, I remember we ran into an issue when we tried using burst length
of 4 with the i2s device on RK3288 because we could get requests that
either weren't aligned or a multiple of 4 sizes and some transfers
would just fail, so we ended up using a burst size of 1.  I recommend
if we aren't sure about size or alignment for a particular peripheral,
a burst size of 1 is safest.  For something like a block device, I
think we can use the larger size bursts.  That's another reason to
include the driver fixes in the series, just so we get it right,
thanks.
