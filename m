This just adds in another field of what's stored in the e-fuse on
rk3288.  Though I can't personally promise that every rk3288 out there
has the CPU ID stored in the eFuse at this location, there is some
evidence that it is correct:
- This matches what was in the Chrome OS 3.14 branch (see
  EFUSE_CHIP_UID_OFFSET and EFUSE_CHIP_UID_LEN) for rk3288.
- The upstream rk3399 dts file has this same data at the same offset
  and with the same length, indiciating that this is likely common for
  several modern Rockchip SoCs.
