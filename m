Ok. got it. check small comment on patch 4 then.

well, that is a bit strange to me. Are you sure you are returning the
-ERANGE? Because, my assumption is that the following of-thermal code
path would return the error code back to core:
 328         if (data->ops->set_trip_temp) {
 329                 int ret;
 330 
 331                 ret = data->ops->set_trip_temp(data->sensor_data, trip, temp);
 332                 if (ret)
 333                         return ret;
 334         }

And this part of thermal core would return it back to sysfs layer:
 757         ret = tz->ops->set_trip_temp(tz, trip, temperature);
 758         if (ret)
 759                 return ret;

or am I missing something?
