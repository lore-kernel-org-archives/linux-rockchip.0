the above clock is part of the interconnect. We don't model that yet, but I 
guess that would make it more a candidate for the handoff-type instead.

I'd guess for the Rockchip side, everything that is CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED should 
be the handoff type (leaf-clocks used by some component we don't control 
yet). 

The clocks we already register as critical most likely are the ones that 
should be critical, as they are central clocks where it causes havok when 
they get disabled :-) .
