Fair enough.

Arghh... So even my favourite Chromebook (from which I'm typing this

The 32bit port only gained a VDSO recently (3.14 doesn't have it), and
mainline doesn't switch the counter off, as you noted above.

As for the 64bit kernel, it would be interesting to verify that on
resume, the VDSO does return the right (corrected) value, and not
something stale.

Thanks,
