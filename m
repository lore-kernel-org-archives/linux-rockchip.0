Yeah, I think the case of clocks is one where we've decided that it
makes sense to add a new clock driver per major SoC, too much changes
between each revision and doing it in DT (which some platforms have
attempted) isn't overall cleaner.

But every OS that wants to use JTAG instead of MMC, or enable JTAG
around MMC, will need to know about this setting, right? So we're not
necessarily leaking linux implementation details into the DT here.
Whether each OS applies the setting is up to them.

That's exactly what I'm looking to avoid -- i.e. I don't want the GRF
driver to need patching for every SoC either, if we can avoid it.

Once the list gets too long, you'll want to add #ifdef SOCNAME and
only build in the tables for some of the SoCs. And then we've all lost
:-)

Or, if you're firmly deciding to keep updating kernel code for all
SoCs, could also just add one platform quirk file in
drivers/soc/rockchip with the postcore_initcall that matches toplevel
compatible per SoC, finds the device node, maps the address range,
sets the value.

That'll give you a place for other platform quirks, if they ever come
up. In one place, even if the other quirks might be in other register
ranges.

It's a bit bikesheddy, but it just seems like adding a driver that
will always need updates is a bit of a heavy solution.
