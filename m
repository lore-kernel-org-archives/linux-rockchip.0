Sam: Oh!  I hadn't noticed that you've been added as a panel
maintainer in commit ef0db94f94a0 ("MAINTAINERS: Add Sam as reviewer
for drm/panel").  Does that mean you are able to provide some advice
for how to land this series?  As far as I know everything is in order
for it to land, but if you are aware of something I need to do to spin
it then please let me know!

Thanks!
