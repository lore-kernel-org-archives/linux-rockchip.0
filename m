Yup, I understand that part, and many SoCs have this same "feature".

Yes...

... but you make it sound like more work than it is.  The genpd already
keeps a list of devices that refer to the power domain.  In fact, the
genpd 'attach' method can be platform-specific, so could be used to keep
track of a list (or a subset) of clocks which are needed for reset.

Correct.  This condition also exists in the clock framework when unused
clocks are disabled, or if you have drivers but PM_RUNTIME is disabled
(which can happen from userspace on a per-device basis) so it needs to
be understood and managed already.

Right.  I'm not arguing that the power domain doesn't have to deal with
device clocks. It has to for sync reset.  The objection I have have is
where these clocks are described.

Isn't that the end goal?

well, I think we can be slightly more accomodating than that and go for
somewhere in between:

D) In the power-domain DTS, clearly describe why each clock is needed by
the power-domain.  In particular list out clocks that are not device
clocks (and why they need to be asserted for reset) and separate those
from device clocks which are only listed in the power-domain because
there is not *yet* a driver/binding for that device node.

Doing it that way also makes it clear that when a new driver/binding is
added, the clocks should be removed from the power-domain node and put
into the device node.

Also, this addresses my primary concern that the DTS acurately describes
the hardware.  IOW, in hardware, most of these clocks are are properties
of devices, not power-domains, and the DT should reflect that.

IMO, if it's not describing the hardware, and is a placeholder until a
driver/binding is in place, it should be properly documented.

Yes, I suspect there are several of those, which is also why I'd like to
see the clocks in the power-domain node described in detail, and exacly 
why they're needed to be enabled.

Also, in the current proposed DTS, clocks that are listed in both device
nodes and the power domain are also suspicous, especially when the
device node doesn't have a power-domain property.  (c.f. vop[bl] nodes
and ACLK_VOP[01] clocks.)  For that matter, this series doesn't add any
devices to the power domains, which makes it even more confusing about
how this is meant to work.  IOW, with no devices belonging to
power-domains, how are the power-domain power_on/power_off callbacks
being called?

shmobile is already doing this with platform-specific genpd attach
callbacks, and using the pm_clk API.  I don't see any issues with that.

No need for me to yell. Your concerns are perfectly valid, and it's not
my style anyways. ;)

Thanks for the feedback,

Kevin
