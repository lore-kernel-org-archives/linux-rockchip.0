Hi Mike, Stephen,

here are some more rockchip-specific clock changes, hopefully still in
time for 4.10.

Apart from some smaller fixes there is one new clock-controller for
the RK1108 (a soc combining a single-core Cortex-A7 with a DSP).


There was a bit of concern from Rob regarding our softer links to
circular input clocks which I tried to explain in [0] and [1] but
haven't heared anything back in nearly a week now from my
initial reply last friday.

He did ack bindings with the same behaviour for the rk3036, rk3228
and rk3399 in the past though, so I can only hope my explanation did
somehow alleviate his concerns.

I've Cc'ed him on this pull request, so hopefully he'll protest if
that isn't the case.


Heiko

  clk: rockchip: add clock controller for rk1108 (2016-11-16 12:37:37 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
A new clock controller for the rk1108 soc (single-core Cortex-A7+DSP),
a fix making sure the cpuclk rate is actually valid, before trying to
set it and a copy-paste fix for the rk3399's testclk.
