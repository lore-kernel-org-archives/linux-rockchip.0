You might want to explain your reasoning for having a dtsi and an empty=
=20
standalone dts. I guess you want to add a second one for module+baseboa=
rd?

The interesting artifact here is, that the baseboard can actually be us=
ed=20
standalone and the baseboard just extends it where in contrast a rk3288=
=20
rock2 for example isn't actually usable without a baseboard.

So I'm wondering if this really should be encoded in the dts or should =
uses=20
something like dts overlays instead to enable one geekbox module to be =
used=20
alone and in the "landingship".

you're introducing
- a new vendor name (geekbuying), so should update=20
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt in a separate pat=

- a new board, so should update=20

why all others also "boot-on" and this one not?


Otherwise that looks fine
