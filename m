I don't think I'm going to try to understand all the math here.  I'll
trust you that this does something sane.

There is a subtle bug here, though it likely doesn't manifest in any
current hardware configurations.

Specifically if you get a clock change on a device with a "v1"
controller while an i2c transaction is happening then you will likely
get i2c errors.

The clock change notifications work like this:
* Before the clock change, adjust the timings based on the faster of
the old/new clock.
* Let the clock change happen.
* If we didn't adjust the timings before, adjust them now.

With the logic above there will be a period where the i2c transaction
is happening slower than ideal, but that should be OK.  ...and you can
imagine the speed of the transaction changing midway through the
transaction--even midway through a single byte.


With v1 some of the timing information is _not_updated by
rk3x_i2c_adapt_div()--it's only set at the start of a transaction.
That breaks all the above assumptions.

So you should probably be updating the the RKI2C_CON register here by
doing a read-modify-write, like:

ctrl = i2c_readl(i2c, REG_CON);
ctrl &= ~REG_CON_TUNING_MASK;
ctrl |= i2c->t_calc.tuning;
i2c_writel(i2c, ctrl, REG_CON);


Also (optional): once you do that, there becomes much less of a reason
to store "t_calc" in "struct rk3x_i2c".  Already you're never using
the "div_low" and "div_high" that you store in the "struct rk3x_i2c".
Of course, to do that you've got to change other places not to clobber
these bits in REG_CON.

This change is incorrect.  Please change it back to being calculated
in a local variable.  Optionally also add a comment that says:

/*
 * Try the calculation (but don't store the result) ahead of
 * time to see if we need to block the clock change.  Timings
 * shouldn't actually take effect until rk3x_i2c_adapt_div().
 */

Specifically in the case that we return NOTIFY_STOP here we _don't_
want to have modified our internal timings.  We also _don't_ want to
have modified our internal timings in the case that the old_rate > the
new_rate.

BTW: Did you manage to find anyone using an old Rockchip SoC that can
test your patches?

This is not matching the bindings.  You are still assuming that "i2c"
clock is the first clock and "pclk" is the one named "pclk".  Said
another way, if you had the following in your device tree:

  clocks =  <&pmucru PCLK_I2C0_PMU>, <&pmucru SCLK_I2C0_PMU>;
  clock-names = "pclk", "i2c";

...you'll find that you'll get back "pclk" twice.  The first time
you'll get it because you asked for the first clock listed, the second
time because you asked for the clock named "pclk".

I'd also say that your life will probably be easier if you always
setup both "clk" and "pclk", even on old CPUs.  It's OK to call
"clk_prepare" twice and OK to call "clk_enable" twice.

Thus, I'd probably write all the code as this (untested):

  if (i2c->soc_data->calc_timings == rk3x_i2c_v0_calc_timings) {
    /* Only one clock to use for bus clock and peripheral clock */
    i2c->clk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL);
    i2c->pclk = i2c->clk;
  } else {
    i2c->clk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "i2c");
    i2c->pclk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "pclk");
  }
  if (IS_ERR(i2c->clk)) {
    ret = PTR_ERR(i2c->clk);
    if (ret != -EPROBE_DEFER)
      dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Can't get bus clk: %d\n", ret);
    return ret;
  }
  if (IS_ERR(i2c->pclk)) {
    ret = PTR_ERR(i2c->pclk);
    if (ret != -EPROBE_DEFER)
      dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Can't get periph clk: %d\n", ret);
    return ret;
  }
  ret = clk_prepare(i2c->clk);
  if (ret < 0) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Can't prepare bus clk: %d\n", ret);
    return ret;
  }
  ret = clk_prepare(i2c->pclk);
  if (ret < 0) {
    dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Can't prepare periph clock: %d\n", ret);
    goto err_clk;
  }

If you take that advice, you can get rid of all of the "if
(i2c->pclk)" statements in your code.
