Thanks for the useful review comments.

With regard to the bugs something between rc1 and rc8 results
in a freeze on poweroff. Power domain doesn't seem to turn off
the vop and hdmi in rc8.
For testing only.

Forgot to ask rob+dt the prefered document name for "rockchip,rk3066-hdmi"
Please advise if this is OK? "rockchip_rk3066-hdmi.txt"

Will add more text in V4.

You try to get rid of it and now I add one more to it ...
Thank you for letting me know.
The file drmP.h is used for:
to_platform_device, platform_get_resource, platform_get_irq
Replaced <drm/drmP.h> by <linux/platform_device.h>

Is this OK?
	int vic; // pointer to the current cea mode in the edid_cea_modes array

hdmi->hdmi_data.vic = drm_match_cea_mode(mode);

Will drop it. Possible leftover when they reused
the inno-hdmi driver as template?

ddc_addr and segment_addr only get a value in the condition below and
are reused.
Should remain global.

	if (msgs->addr == DDC_SEGMENT_ADDR)
		hdmi->i2c->segment_addr = msgs->buf[0];
	if (msgs->addr == DDC_ADDR)
		hdmi->i2c->ddc_addr = msgs->buf[0];

Will change the name to i2c_lock.

Agree.

That sounds more like a job for the Rockchip maintainers and
not for a individual. With this driver they have 8 more to go ...

	ADD_ROCKCHIP_SUB_DRIVER(vop_platform_driver, CONFIG_DRM_ROCKCHIP);
	ADD_ROCKCHIP_SUB_DRIVER(rockchip_lvds_driver,

Will rename hdmi->regmap to hdmi->grf_regmap to make it look more different
between hdmi devm_ioremap and grf syscon_regmap.

Looks like it. That's something only the author can tell.

Will replace the other hdmi->dev in this function by dev as well.

Don't know what should be used instead. Please advise.

Agree. But I prefere sentinel ...

{ .compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-hdmi"},
{ /* sentinel */ },

"rockchip,rk3066-hdmi" is related to "rockchip,rk3066-vop"

"rockchip-rk3066hdmi" should remain in line with the other debug messages,
else it gets a mess if you do a dmesg | grep ...
