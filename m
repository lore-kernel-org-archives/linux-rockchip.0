There is a mechanism to detect if the link is up before starting
enumeration or am I wrong ?

Probably what we should be discussing here is what are the causes
for the link to go down *unexpectedly* - in other words - what
makes that racy check "likely" to work - which was the initial
question, by the way.

See above - I want to understand what your 98% and 2% actually represent.
