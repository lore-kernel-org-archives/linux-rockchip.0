They are not connected.

Right, we had a "legacy" GPIO/button mapping on original Pixels that
used T9 multitouch reports, then we switched to a bit different mapping
for newer devices that use T100 multitouch reports.

We should really have explicit map, like we have in upstream driver.

I think I can ACK it:
