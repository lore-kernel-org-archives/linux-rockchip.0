No, it's not.  But the board I submitted the patch for doesn't have
anything like hot swapable ram.  The ram access is still going to work,
just it might display something it shouldn't. Say for example if that
frame buffer got reused by somethig else and filled with new data in
the very small window.

But yes, I agree the best solution would be to not release the buffer
until the next vblank.

Perhaps a good solution would be for the DRM api to have the concept of
a deferred release?  Meaning if the put() call just added the frame
buffer to a list that DRM core could walk during the vblank.  That
might be better then every single driver trying to work up a custom
solution.

I don't have those boards anymore, and I don't have access to any
technical documentation on the GPU so I can't really add much here.  
Eric can probably provide the best information.

I submitted the patch because I was working on arm64 support for fun
and was becomming very annoyed by desktop lockups for long periods of
time on the desktop enviroment of my choice due to the driver being
flooded with curser animation updates.  I sent the patch to Eric who
was kind enough to review it and suggest some improvements.
