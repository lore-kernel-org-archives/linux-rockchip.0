Could we wait until there exists a SoC that needs to provide
baseclkfreq in its sdhci_arasan_soc_ctl_map table and that needs this
value copied from register[15:8]?

AKA:

A) If you have a SoC where clk_get_rate() is right and software needs
to set baseclkfreq manualy, then you should include "baseclkfreq" in
your sdhci_arasan_soc_ctl_map table.  This is like rk3399.  Note that
if _both_ clk_get_rate() and register[15:8] are right, that's fine.
We can still use clk_get_rate() since it will be exactly the same as
register[15:8].

B) If you have a SoC that doesn't even expose corecfg_baseclkfreq to
software control, just don't include "baseclkfreq" in your
sdhci_arasan_soc_ctl_map table.  Easy.  This is how my patch treats
anyone using the current "generic" bindings, but you could easily just
specify an offset of "-1" for baseclkfreq if you didn't want to use
the generic bindings but couldn't control baseclkfreq.

C) If you have a SoC that provides a valid value in register[15:8] and
clk_get_rate() is wrong and software is required to copy the value
from register[15:8] to baseclkfreq, technically we should fix
clk_get_rate() anyway.  It's good when common clock framework provides
correct values.  NOTE: It seems very unlikely to me that
register[15:8] would be right AND that software would be required to
copy this value to baseclkfreq, but I suppose there are some pretty
crazy hardware designs out there.

D) If you have a SoC that provides a valid value in register[15:8] and
clk_get_rate() is wrong and can't be fixed (REALLY?) and software is
required to copy the value from register[15:8] to baseclkfreq, we will
need to add new code.  My assertion is that such a SoC doesn't exist
and is unlikely to ever exist, so I am hesitant to add extra code to
support this SoC.


With my patch, A) and B) are certainly handled.  I think C) is
unlikely to exist, but if it did exist then I'd say we should fix
clk_get_rate().  I think D) is VERY unlikely to exist.  If I'm shown
proof of D) existing, I'm happy to submit a patch for it.  Until we
see proof of D)'s existence, I don't think we should clutter the code
with support for it.
