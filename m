Okay, that matches the picture that's been forming in my mind after

Good, that also matches what I understood from reading the driver code.

Interestingly, though, it seems like the PHYs for both i.MX and Rockchip
are register-compatible because they work with the same driver code. It
could be coincidence, or simply that they both use some standard PHY as
provided by DW along with the HDMI transmitter IP.

Most importantly, like you said, any "damage" has already been done and
in order to keep devices working with existing DTBs we'll have to add
fallback code for backwards-compatibility. I'm thinking instantiating
I2C clients for drivers matching the i.MX/Rockchip code directly from
the HDMI bridge driver if no child nodes are found in DTB.

As for finding somebody with the motivation and time to do it, I suspect
we could just wait for the next user of DW HDMI IP and let them deal
with it. Perhaps documenting our findings in the driver would be helpful
if that time comes.

For the matter at hand, I think we all agree that keeping the supplies
Rockchip-specific for now is the right thing to do.
