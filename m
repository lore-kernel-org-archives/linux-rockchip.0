Not exactly, even if this involves pin muxing.

Well, to sum-up, the discussion started because Andy notice that some
boards were no longer booting, and found out that commit 87248991a1de
("regulator: pwm: Properly initialize the ->state field") was causing
the regression, because ->get_voltage_sel() was returning -EINVAL,
which in turn was caused by a missing entry in the voltage table.

Doug also noted that Andy was expecting the pin connected to the PWM
regulator to stay in a GPIO+input state until the PWM is really
enabled, in order to avoid glitches. But this not the case currently,
since the PWM chip claims all the pins at probe time.

So, there are 2 different problems here:
1/ the board no longer boots because of commit 87248991a1de and a
   missing entry in the voltage table
2/ claiming the PWM pins at probe time can cause glitches

I'm currently trying to solve #1, but most of the discussion in this
thread was about addressing #2.

Hm, okay, but which state should we choose? The first entry in the
voltage-table?

Yes, but that means patching the DT, which means breaking the DT compat.
