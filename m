They are all using side-band interrupt?  What WiFi device do you have connected?

If you're truly using a side-band interrupt using the dedicated SDIO
interrupt pin on your SoC, I'm pretty sure you still need to define
cap-sdio-irq in order for things to work properly.  If you don't do
that, you'll get "polling mode" for SDIO Interrupts.  See
sdio_irq_thread() where you can see that the kernel will poll your
device every 10 ms if MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ isn't set.

Maybe you should try defining cap-sdio-irq and see if you get a big
performance boost?
