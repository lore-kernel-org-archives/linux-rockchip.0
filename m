Hi Kishon,

Since the Shawn isn't available, I take over this series patches for now.

As the original bug had tracked on https://issuetracker.google.com/71561742.
In some cases, the mmc phy power on failed during booting up.
The log as below:
...
[   2.375333] rockchip_emmc_phy_power: caldone timeout.
[    2.377815] phy phy-ff770000.syscon:phy@f780.4: phy poweron failed --> -110
...
[    2.489295] mmc0: mmc_select_hs400es failed, error -110
[    2.489302] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising MMC card
..

The actual emulate, the wait 5us for calpad busy trimming, that's no enough.
We need give the enough margin for it.

Verified on url =
        https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chromeos-4.4
This series patches can apply and bring up with kernel-next on rk3399 chromebook.
