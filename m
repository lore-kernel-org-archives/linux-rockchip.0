More generally, as mentioned in the commit message, it's a module, so
automatically I did a .dtsi to allow for easy reuse.

At LinuxCon JP I had discussed with Grant Likely about whether it's oka=
y
to #include a .dts rather than .dtsi and don't remember getting a clear
answer as we ended up drawing a line between hardware and FPGA.

And yes, I may later add a .dts for the Landingship - it would mainly
enable more nodes, I envision. But I assume that we're not bound to jus=
t
the Landingship with such a standard connector.

=46or now I'm more interested in incrementally adding further nodes to =
the
module's own file.

Well, with the Parallella I made the experience that I used a single
=2Edts initially, and it turned out to be a bad choice when we tried
adding stuff to the DT while new hardware models surfaced - we still
haven't managed to split it up and it's stuck in limbo without USB.
I'd really like to avoid that going forward, so I'm trying to look
forward here in keeping our options open with a clean design.

How would your overlay get loaded? Wouldn't that need some special
kernel driver like for the BeagleBone? Not so attractive for a single
optional baseboard I care about.

True. I did not check whether they're NASDAQ-listed either, but I assum=
e
no; haven't compared the downstream DT for what they might've been usin=
g
themselves.

> why all others also "boot-on" and this one not?

Good question. I had to fiddle with voltages and always-on / boot-on to
get things to work so far, it kept probing with -EINVAL earlier.

According to the schematics, the PLL is behind vdd_10, so it probably
should be boot-on, too. I'm now less certain whether some of the others
should be boot-on though, in particular in light of RK3368 mainline
U-Boot not existing yet and choices possibly being different there.

Counter-question: Why does the -r88.dts have them all as fixed
regulators? I simply assumed here that the RK808-B is sufficiently
compatible with rockchip,rk808?

Andreas
