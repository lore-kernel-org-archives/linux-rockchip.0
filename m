I think in practise for most cases you don't need a completely exact
duty_cycle/period setting. Some inaccuracy is fine, but how much and in
which directions might differ. Also the consumer might not care if it
gets 30% duty cycle with an inversed polarity or 70% with a normal one.
Some consumer might care about duty-cycle/period ratio, another about
the absolute value of period. Then yes, if you really need

	.duty_cycle =3D 100, .period =3D 500

it doesn't help you that the driver suggests 99/498 instead. But it also
doesn't hurt.

This is less powerful than my suggestion. With .accuracy implemented in
the lowlevel drivers, how would you request 20 % duty cycle with period
<=3D 1 ms? With my round_rate suggestion it would be:

	mystate.duty_cycle =3D 200000;
	mystate.period =3D 1000000;

   retry:
	pwm_round_rate(pwm, &mystate);

	if mystate.period * 2 =3D=3D mystate.duty_cycle * 10:
		pwm_apply_state(pwm, &mystate)
		return 0
	elif mystate.period =3D=3D 0:
		return -ESOMETHING
	elif mystate.period * 2 < mystate.duty_cycle * 10:
		mystate.duty_cycle -=3D 1
		goto retry
	elif mystate.duty_cycle =3D=3D 0:
		return -ESOMETHING
	else
		mystate.period -=3D 1
		goto retry

(if some derivation is ok, this can be implemented in the respective
checks)

Even if a deviation of 1 % is ok for me, with your proposal I would end
with 99 / 498, while I could have 99 / 495 which better matches my needs.
(And if I start with mystate.duty_cycle =3D 100 and mystate.period =3D 500
above, I will hit that value-pair with the second call to
pwm_round_rate().)

With your suggestion requesting

	.duty_cycle =3D 100, .period =3D 500, .accuracy =3D 1

the driver is free to set

	.duty_cycle =3D 100000000, .period =3D 500000000

as possible / requested is 1. This for sure isn't ok for all consumers.

Also with the above request I might prefer

	.duty_cycle =3D 98, .period =3D 500

over

	.duty_cycle =3D 101, .period =3D 500

even thought the latter is better according to your metric.

I admit this is not free of complexity to use. But this is because the
problem is not trivial. And it is powerful enough that a helper function
that gets a state and a needed accuracy as you suggested above, can be
implemented.

See above suggestion. When there is only just pwm_set_state_exact() the
only way to implement "20 % duty cycle with period <=3D 1 ms" by iterating
over the whole set of allowed values until you find a hit. (Also if
.accuracy is used, you have to go with the first hit unless you iterate
over the good set of parameters several times with giving the driver
more freedom to derivate in each loop.)

It doesn't. Still there are algorithms that allow to determine the best
set of duty_cycle and period (whatever "best" currently means to you) in
a more effective way than by a testing each good state.

Full ack. A consumer trying to guess what the exact restriction is, is
bound to fail in at least some cases. But as this is not necessary (as
shown above) this argument is irrelevant.
