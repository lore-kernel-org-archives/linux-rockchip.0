Oh, apologize for reviewing the old version!

That makes sense to me! I think it would also follow other phy clients
use of the phy API.

What makes me wonder though is from a power management point of view.
*When* do you need to have phy initialized and powered?

1) For a removable card can leave the phy uninitialised or powered
off, but still detect card insertion/removal via GPIO? Is that a valid
scenario for you?

2) Considering the runtime PM case for the sdhci device. Typically you
can gate clocks etc at runtime suspend to save power, but what about
the phy? Can you power off it in runtime suspend?

Kind regards
