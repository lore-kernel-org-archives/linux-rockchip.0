yes, and i'm wondering would it make more sense to somehow ignore those 
irqs(triggered by other devices, and we don't really need to care since 
we already unregistered) than trying to hold all needed resources(clks & 
power domains & some other resources maybe) for that?

maybe we can just make sure the irq handler unregistered when we stop 
caring about the irqs? or maybe add a flag to tell the irq handler to 
stop processing them?
