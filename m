Because we already have a plan for entire vm_fault_t migration and
the * instruction * was to send one patch per driver.

We are going in circles here. That you want to convert vm_insert_page
to vmf_insert_page for the PF case is fine and understood. However,
you don't *need* to introduce a new name for the remaining non-PF
cases if the function is going to be the exact same thing as before.
You say "The final goal is to remove vm_insert_page", but you haven't
justified *why* you need to remove that name.

I think I have given that answer. If we don't remove vm_insert_page,
future #PF caller will have option to use it. But those should be
restricted. How are we going to restrict vm_insert_page in one half
of kernel when other half is still using it  ?? Is there any way ? ( I don't
know)
