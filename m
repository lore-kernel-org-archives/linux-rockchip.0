You don't understand my idea. If the hardware cannot implement the
requested state the round_state function has to return a best
approximation according to some rules. After that the consumer can
decide if they want that or not. As the hardware isn't touched nothing
bad happens.

(Well, apart from that I still cannot imagine a use case where with the
current possibilities of the PWM API a consumer can really care about
the polarity.)

Same as above. If I asked for duty_cycle =3D 5 ns and get back duty_cycle
=3D 0 ns this means the driver cannot implement a duty_cycle in the
interval (0, 5] ns, nothing more. =

If the value is then known to be the best (or good enough if the
consumer doesn't really care), it is used. Otherwise a different state
is rounded or the consumer gives up if it becomes clear that the
hardware cannot satisfy their needs.

> How does it know how to scale them if the deviation is not okay?

It depends on what the consumer considers optimal. I already gave one
example code how I think pwm_round_state should be used. Another is:

If the consumer wants a period as near as possible to a given target
period the algorithm with the round_state function as suggested would
look as follows (duty_cycle ignored here for the ease of discussion):

		mystate.period =3D target_period
		...
		pwm_round_state(pwm, &mystate)

		if (mystate.period =3D=3D target_period)
			return mystate.period

		mystate.period =3D 2 * target_period - mystate.period
		pwm_round_state(pwm, &mystate)

		if (mystate.period < target_period)
			return mystate.period;

		do {
			best_bigger =3D mystate.period
			mystate.period -=3D 1
			pwm_round_state(pwm, &mystate)
		} while (mystate.period > target_period)

		return best_bigger

The above algorithm answers this question.

Theoretically the requirements for pwm_round_state could be changed such
that it is supposed to yield the nearest hit instead of the next smaller
one, but this only shifts the complexity to a different area. (I think
my suggestion is the better one though because the math for the lowlevel
drivers and also the helper functions is easier then. Also the search
terminates earlier if the consumer wants something bigger than the
driver can implement. Moreover "biggest value not bigger than requested"
is (IMHO) easier to understand for the affected coders than "nearest
value" because there are more ugly special cases. (Consider I ask for
(duty_cycle, period) =3D (10, 20) and the driver can implement (9, 18) and
(12, 21). Which of these is nearer?))

Best regards
Uwe
