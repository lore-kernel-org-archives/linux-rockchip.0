The former rk1108 got a new name: rv1108. It is still early for its
development and there are no devices in the wild, except the internal
evaluation board. So we're somewhat safe in reanming things now,
before things spread to much.

My basic idea for merging is the individual changes (pinctrl, clk)
going through the respective maintainer trees and I've added necessary
dts glue, so that it doesn't break bisectability or fail to compile
even though the internal board wouldn't care.
After the pieces are in mainline (after 4.12-rc1?) we can then just
do the dts renames.


changes in v2:
- drop mmc binding patch, which got applied
- rebased pinctrl patches onto pinctrl tree
- adapted patches, so that they don't break when applied individually
- fixed recipients (mturquette)
