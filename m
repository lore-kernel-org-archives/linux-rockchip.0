Oh, I see what you mean, driver could still set 3.3 voltage supply
even they don't support 3V3 signal voltage.

Indeed, there is a risk of breaking some drivers if they don't set the
capabilities correctly.

So, I think we could drop this patch since patch 4 is actually what we
need in order to slove our problem. :)
