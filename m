Hi Arnd, Kevin, Olof,

please find below two fixes for 64bit Rockchip devicetrees.

As the tag explains the main change is the revert of the rk3368 opp
addition, as this cannot safely run on current rk3368 boards and thus
shouldn't make a kernel release.


Please pull, thanks
Heiko

  arm64: dts: rockchip: Correct MIPI DPHY PLL clock on rk3399 (2017-09-19 19:25:10 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Adding the operating points on rk3368 like they were did not end up well
for the boards as all of them are missing their cpu supplies, the opps
actually need to follow the <target min max> format as the regulator is
shared between both clusters and the one rk3368 board I have, somehow also
doesn't like the higher opps at all - all of which I only realized after
I brought my rk3368 board online again, after its bootloader broke.

And a fix for the mipi dsi controller on rk3399, which was referencing
a clock to high up in the clock-tree so that an intermediate gate could
be disabled inadvertently.
rk3368-board I have in my farm did not like the h
