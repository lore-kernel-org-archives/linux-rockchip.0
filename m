I'll semi-disagree about the TRM: the TRM doesn't seem to agree with
itself, so it sometimes agrees with you and sometimes doesn't :)

On page 79 of the 2nd (?) book, it looks like {SDMMC,SDIO}_CON{0,}[2:1]
are {drv,sample}_degree. But on page 208 of the 1st book, those are put
at bits [1:0].

Perhaps we can get a straight answer from Rockchip though.
