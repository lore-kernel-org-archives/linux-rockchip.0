Yes, this is difficult, although I expect a simple approach of setting
the input as fast as possible would work reasonably well in practice.
But even when the input is a mux with a fixed set of possible rates it
is difficult to extract its maximum frequency within the clock
framework.

I hadn't considered that, I assumed there would be a strong preference
for enhancing the generic code rather than writing a special case
implementation.

Yes, I wouldn't suggest changing the clock mux in the upstream kernel.
I was hoping specifying an assigned parent in DT would be enough to keep
the parent set correctly, but it doesn't seem to be.

The sensible heuristic is to minimize the length of the clock path when
there are two equally good routes, which would handle the case where the
I2S clock can be generated without the need for a fractional divider.
But I don't think the clock framework has any way to take into account
that a mux may end up bypassing another clock.

It seems that even without the fractional divider we can't get low
enough jitter to meet our requirements, so we've decided to use an
external clock for I2S.  As a result of that, we're no longer using this
part of the clock tree at all, so I'm happy to drop these patches.
