Wait. This is a bit confusing. The utility of adding a property name
and using that name be the reboot command parsed for made sense
(compared to earlier versions which had command strings) as it made
the dts more terse.   But it sounds here like you're suggesting we
should have some logic in the driver that translates "reboot fastboot"
to mode-bootloader or vice versa.

Hrm. So how what reboot command do you expect to trigger that?

Though I do like the vendor specific prefix here, as it clarifies how
universal the command is (and its easy add standard commands if they
become more established and remap things in the future).

I think one of the difficult things here is that there's no real
standards for all bios/bootloader modes. So they are somewhat
firmware/bootloader/device specific, and thus we need something that
is flexible enough to allow lots of different modes to be easily
specified.  That said, this does expose a userspace interface (though
one could argue kernel ABI doesn't cross reboots :) so we should try
to have some consistency so the same userspace can work on various
devices.

I do think the "bootloader" and "recovery" arguments are somewhat
defacto standards, well established on most android devices.

I think here the concern is rockchip probably has some userspace that
is already using "reboot maskrom" or "reboot loader" for their own
uses. And its a bit of a pain to ask that userspace to be reworked to
use "reboot rom-download" or "reboot rockchip,rom-download" depending
on how we try to deal with these.  (Granted, non-upstream interfaces
aren't official, so that is their risk somewhat, but we avoid being
smug about that :)

Another part of the issue is there isn't really a way to probe for
reboot cmd capability here. As much as I'd rather not complicate
things, one couldn't easily extend existing userspace to work with
current kernels as well as future kernels, since the reboot with an
invalid command won't fail. The machine still resets. So you can't try
one and fallback to the other.

Maybe there needs to be a sysfs entry with the list of the supported commands?
