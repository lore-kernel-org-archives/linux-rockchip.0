Looks happy to me now.  Since I'm not a DRM expert and almost
certainly don't know much about gamma LUT, take this as you will:

Reviewed-by: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

I'm not in front of my veyron device at the moment, so I can't re-test
exactly this patch so I won't add a Tested-by tag.  However, I'll note
that earlier versions worked for the test app I was able to find in
Chrome OS and I'd imagine this one does too.
