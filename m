Ha! OK, fair enough, back to the first point then...

I notice that the 4.4 BSP kernel consistently specifies "aclk" and 
"hclk" for the IOMMU instances - it feels unusual to say "why don't we 
follow the downstream binding?", but it does look a lot like what I 
would expect (I'd guess at one for the register slave interface and one 
for the master interface/general operation?)

If we can implement conceptually-correct clock handling based on an 
accurate binding, which should cover most cases, and *then* look at 
hacking around those where it doesn't quite work in practice due to 
shortcomings elsewhere, that would be ideal, and of course a lot nicer 
than just jumping straight into piles of hacks.

Robin.
