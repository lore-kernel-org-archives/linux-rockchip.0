Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below the pull request with main Rockchip-releated clock
changes for 4.9.

The signed tag should hopefully explain the contents sufficiently,
so if nothing stands out please pull.

On the matter of critical clocks, I'm still hoping for the handover type
to materialize soonish and am hoping of doing the conversion in one go,
instead of making everything critical now and then having to go through
the list yet again.

Thanks
Heiko

  clk: rockchip: use the dclk_vop_frac clock ids on rk3399 (2016-09-04 23:48:19 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest addition is probably the special clock-type for ddr clock
control. While reading that clock is done the normal way from the
registers, setting it always requires some sort of special handling
to let the system survive this addition.

As the commit message explains, there are currently 3 handling-types
known. General SRAM-based code on rk3288 and before (which is waiting
essentially for the PIE support that is currently being worked on),
SCPI-based clk setting on the rk3368 through a coprocessor, which we
might support once the support for legacy scpi-variants has matured
and now on the rk3399 (and probably later) using a dcf controller that
is controlled from the arm-trusted-firmware and gets accessed through
firmware calls from the kernel. This is the variant we currently
support, but the clock type is made to support the other variants in
the future as well.

Apart from that slightly bigger chunk, we have a mix of PLL rates,
clock-ids and flags mainly for the rk3399.

And interestingly an iomap fix for the legacy gate driver, where I
hopefully could deter the submitter from actually using that in any
new works.
