FWIW, the two brief references in the TRM imply that's the ATB clock, 
which would make it part of the CoreSight tracing gubbins[1] - I can't 
see any evidence that RK3288 has an ETR or ETB for self-hosted tracing, 
so it may well only be relevant for external trace hardware (wherein 
GRF_SOC_CON7 suggests that it might spew trace data out of the parallel 
LCD interface pins).

Similarly, pclk_dbg sounds like the APB clock for the CPU external debug 
interface[2] (which I suspect is probably somewhere in that "A17_Debug" 
region at 0xffb80000 that the DT doesn't even go near).

I would imagine that as long as a hardware debugger can establish a 
JTAG/SWD connection to the DAP, it would then have an initialisation 
script which knows what values to poke where in order to configure 
additional pinmux/clocks/CoreSight components/etc. to the appropriate 
state, so I'd hope that Linux shouldn't have to care about those details 
either way.
