To quote Levin from the other mail:
--------
The "mute" pin is a output only GPIO, which is already supported by 
setting flags in the gpio-syscon
  driver. And yes, this pin has a defined function, but can also be used 
for general purpose operation.
--------

So to summarize, the documentation calls it "mute", but it is usable as
a general pin, which is the reason Levin is working on it - because on his
board this pin is used to switch between two voltages (aka a gpio-regulator)
for the sdmmc controller [3.3V + 1.8V].

Available pin settings are output-enable + of course the high/low setting
and I think I remember there is even a pull setting for it in the GRF 
somewhere - but my memory might be fuzzy here.
