Maybe not a great one. I figured they were somewhat controversial, so I
at least wanted to split the "cpufreq patches" (i.e., this and the
previous) from the main DTS(I) additions. I also figured we typically
like to keep the base SoC changes separate from the board DTS(I)
changes.

Right. Additionally, as noted on the previous patch, we might do the
same with EVB. But I don't know what the regulators are like for EVB.
This is probably a bigger deal, since EVB has been working (allegedly)
upstream for a while now.

There's no way to split these up without either breaking compilation or
breaking bisectability. For Kevin/Gru, they don't function at all before
this series, so I figured some "settle" time wasn't a huge deal.

That'd be OK with me, as long as we're also confident about EVB.

Maybe at a minimum, I should just patch in some empty regulator nodes,
so cpufreq doesn't think there's no need to handle voltage.
