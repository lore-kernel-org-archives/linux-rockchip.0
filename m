ah, so the ehci controller needs that 480m clock as well? Do you happen to 
have example patches for the ehci/ohci side already? I'd like to peak at what 
you mean with "some PM suspend process related" things.

Depending on what is actually needed, you could also pull the usbphy out of 
autosuspend in a pm-prepare callback of the phy driver itself ... see 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/pm.h#L86

Like 
- in the .prepare callback make sure to unsuspend the phy
  and deactivate the autosuspend
- ehci/ohci will poweroff the phy in it s suspend callback (already does that)
- suspend -> resume
- ehci/ohci will poweron the phy
- in the phy's .complete callback you can reactivate the autosuspend timer

Because it looks more like you actually need the phy and not the clock alone.
So it would be nicer to use mechanisms already in place instead of creating 
new dependencies.

Nope, no argument from me as I fully understand that each phy provides its own 
480m clock :-) .
