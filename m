Hi,

Can you give a bit more rationale here? There would need to be a very
specific reason because of the following:

The crypto module is not wired to some board-specific components,
so its usability does not depend on the specific board at all.
Instead every board can just use it out of the box and the devicetree
is supposed to describe the hardware and is _not_ meant as a space
for user configuration.

So in fact the status property should probably go away completely from
the crypto node, as it's usable out of the box in all cases.
