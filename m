Hi all,

This series patches are based on kernel 4.5-rc1 version, also
is based on Heiko's branch.
(kernel/git/mmind/linux-rockchip.git -b for-next & v4.5-clk/fixes)

e.g: boot log..
Linux version 4.5.0-rc1+ (wxt@ubuntu) ....#60 SMP Thu Jan 28 12:54:50 CST 2016

1) The kylin history series patches:

V0:

V4:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/1/28/132

This series patches are verified on the following github:
https://github.com/Caesar-github/rockchip/tree/kylin/next

This series has 8 patches: (8--->1)
c455bf5 ARM: dts: rockchip: support the spi for rk3036
41bbd5d ASoC: rt5616: add the mclk for the codec driver
6ee2dc0 ASoC: rt5616: trivial: fix the typo
2775e41 ASoC: rt5616: add mclk property for rt5616 document
b4ec10b ARM: dts: rockchip: add mclk for rt5616 on kylin board
8d272a1 ARM: dts: rockchip: add support emac for RK3036
02e501f clk: rockchip: rk3036: fix and add node id for emac clock
b948f42 ARM: dts: rockchip: add hdmi/vop device node for rk3036
....

This series patches can apply into Heiko for-next branch.
(https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/mmind/linux-rockchip.git/log/?h=for-next)
Also, ths ASoC can apply into Mark branch.

2) This series patches have the following decriptions:

PATCH[1/8]: ====> add hdmi/vop display node for rk3036
ARM: dts: rockchip: add hdmi/vop device node for rk3036

This Patch is based on Ykk's Inno HDMI V7 patches. That's verified on
my github.

bd5ed3e ARM: dts: rockchip: add hdmi/vop device node for rk3036
438e7bd FROMLIST: dt-bindings: add document for Innosilicon HDMI on Rockchip platform
((am from https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8117611/))
ad0623b FROMLIST: drm/rockchip: hdmi: add Innosilicon HDMI support
((am https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8117571/))

PATCH[2/8-3/8]: Add the emac patch

The emac clock is depend APLL, That shoud be incorrect.
We should fix it on the DPLL.

df91ab ARM: dts: rockchip: add support emac for RK3036
d5c2781 clk: rockchip: rk3036: fix and add node id for emac clock

That's verified on kylin board with ubuntu os.

How to test and verify?

You can refer to the following wiki document.
http://rockchip.wikidot.com/linux-develop-guide

PATCH[4/8-7/8]: Make the codec work on kylin board

41bbd5d ASoC: rt5616: add the mclk for the codec driver
6ee2dc0 ASoC: rt5616: trivial: fix the typo
2775e41 ASoC: rt5616: add mclk property for rt5616 document
b4ec10b ARM: dts: rockchip: add mclk for rt5616 on kylin board

As the previous discussed on https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8041001/
Move the mclk into codec driver to enable and disable.

PATCH[8/8]: Make the codec work on kylin board

Add the spi node for rk3036 dts, that's seem not related to the kylin.
Maybe the future will support the spi on kylin board or connect the spi devices.

f0fff43 ARM: dts: rockchip: support the spi for rk3036
