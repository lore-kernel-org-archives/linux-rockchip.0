It seems it should be enough to implement runtime PM in the PCI
controller. Isn't each PCI WAKE# line is wired from each PCI device
to the PCI controller?

Then the PCI controller can figure out from which PCI device the
WAKE# came from.

I don't think this is needed, it should be enough to have just
the PCI controller implement runtime PM :)

Tony
