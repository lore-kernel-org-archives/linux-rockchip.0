In an off-list chat with Sakari we found that it would make sense to
leave patches 01 and 12 away as well, in order to avoid uAPI
compatibility issues for good. The MIPI CSI-2 receiver bindings and
driver can be merged, as the only difference in the new setup will be
that on the RK3568 the receiver is connected to the new MUX subdevice,
rather than to a sensor (as will be the case on e.g. the RK3588).

Can we agree on the following plan:
 1) You shall merge patches 02/18 - 11/18 + 13/18 - 17/18.
 2) I shall add the MUX subdev and send a revised version of patches 01,
    12, 18 along with it.
 3) We shall have a solid basis to implement split mode in the DPHY
    driver, RK3568 ISP support (if anyone has time for that), and RK3588
    VICAP support.

OK for everyone? @Laurent: can we get an Ack from you?

Best regards,
Michael
