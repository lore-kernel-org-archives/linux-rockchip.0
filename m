I still in general have mistrust for TRM docs for things like this.
Have you verified that this was an intentional change for rk3399, or
could it be a  typo?  Typically SoCs don't change this type of stuff
for no reason.

This should be possible to verify in one of two ways.  If the TRM has
a typo and things truly _do_ start at 0 instead of 1, then:

1. There will be roughly mirrors of valid ranges.
2. Things won't match up if we change tuning to use 180 course offsets
and the rest fine offsets.

It would be ideal if you could confirm with the chip guys, but if you
can't I'll try to do more tests tomorrow.
