For patch #1 I think it could just go in directly to the wireless
tree.  It should be fine to land the rest of the patches separately.

For patch #2 - #5 then what you say makes sense to me.  I suppose
you'd want at least a Reviewed-by from Arend and an Ack from Kalle on
the Broadcom patches?

I'd also suggest that we Cc stable explicitly when applying.  That's
easy for #2 and #3 since they have a Fixes tag.  For #4 and #5 I guess
the question is how far back to go.  Maybe Adrian has an opinion here
since I think he's the one who experienced these problems.


Thanks!
