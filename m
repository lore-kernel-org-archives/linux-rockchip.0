No other subsystem?

* i2c allows numbering devices by alias
* rtc allows numbering devices by alias.
* serial allows numbering devices by alias.
* spi allows numbering devices by alias.
* watchdog allows numbering devices by alias.

...at least that's my impression doing a grep for of_alias_get_id(),
which I suggested earlier in this thread but apparently wasn't done.

USB is, by definition, hotplug and probable and there is no ordering.
For peripherals built-in to a SoC there is a sane ordering.  Thus
hotplug peripherals and builtin peripherals shouldn't have the same
requirements.

Quite honestly, it _would_ be quite convenient that if you are on a
SoC and you know it has builtin USB controllers to have the root hubs
numbered in a sane and consistent manner.  An area for a future patch,
maybe.

Are you quite certain about that?  See above.

Ethernet is often provided by USB and thus hotplug and probable.
Quite honestly if there was a builtin Ethernet adapter provided on a
SoC (not connected over USB), it would be super handy if it was forced
to be "eth0" (and if there were more than one if they could be ordered
in a way that made sense for that SoC).  Dynamic ordering could come
after.

Sure.  For hotplug, there is no sane device ordering.

For things built in to an SoC, there is sane device ordering.  Dynamic
ordering should come after static.

Because technically it makes it easier for people to understand their
system to have a sane ordering for builtin peripherals.
