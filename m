Right.  I have no objection to Xing's patch.  I just want to make sure
that if it's listed as "Optional" that it's really optional.

I was worried that we would introduce some GRF-based mux in the
_middle_ of some existing clock tree because we simply didn't model
the mux before and assumed one particular setting.  If nothing like
that ever happens then we're fine.

Sorry to be so confusing.
