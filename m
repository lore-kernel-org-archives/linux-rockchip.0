So just to summarize:

* Add pwm_get_state(), pwm_apply_state(), pwm_get_args().
pwm_get_state() initially returns 0 for duty cycle if driver doesn't
support readout.

* Re-implement pwm_get_period() (and maybe other similar functions)
atop pwm_get_state() as you describe earlier in the thread.

* Document pwm_get_period() (and maybe other similar functions) as deprecated.

* Fix drivers for all current 2 users of PWM regulator to support
hardware readout.

* Update PWM regulator as you described earlier in the thread (Feb 23).

* If PWM regulator is ever used on a new board whose PWM doesn't
support hardware readout, the voltage will change at probe time.


Did I get all that right?  Thanks!
