We could see an obvious race condition by test that
the former write operation by IDMAC aiming to clear
OWN bit reach right after the later configuration of
the same desc, which makes the IDMAC be in SUSPEND
state as the OWN bit was cleared by the asynchronous
write operation of IDMAC. The bug can be very easy
reproduced on RK3288 or similar when lowering the
bandwidth of bus and aggravating the Qos to make the
large numbers of IP fight for the priority. One possible
replaceable solution may be alloc dual buff for the
desc to avoid it but could still race each other
theoretically.
