I didn't saw this comment. The second cell is from the standard PWM binding
as all the other PWM drivers uses. e.g.:
pwms=<&controller PWM-channel PWM-period PWM-flags>

With these changes, if pwm-cells=1 then only PWM-channel will be parsed,
if it is 2 PWM-channel and PWM-period will be parsed, if pwm-cells=3
then PWM-channel, PWM-period and PWM-flags will be parsed.
In your driver you used to have only one cell because you wanted to allow
user to give as argument only PWM channel, and you did not want a change
of PWM period (and in of_xlate function you initialize pwm period with 0xffff
value: this is why I changed the binding in patch 7 of this series, file
rk3399-gru-kevin.dts). But e.g. sysfs could try to change the PWM period,
there is no restriction to change the PWM period from sysfs, in the sysfs
interface but the restriction is in PWM apply of the drive. The same things
happens with these changes too. The user could introduce any PWM period via
DT but the pwm apply function of the driver will return error.

Thanks,
Claudiu
