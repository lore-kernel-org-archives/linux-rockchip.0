Hi Neil,

I see most other documentation files don't have such a header,
including the arm,mali-utgard.txt one.  I left it in my patch
after copying the file from the driver tarball as removing it
didn't seem right from a GPL and copyright point of view.  If
it's safe in practice to remove it then fine.

Sure.  It's a bit more complicated with Midgard (more variants,
some have the number of cores in the last digit...) but it should
be possible to put together a suitable list in v3.

Well, fine although I'm a bit confused about this - please see
below.

OK, can change that in v3.  It means however that the out-of-tree
driver will need to be patched as it's looking for these names in
capital letters.  This shouldn't be a big issue but adds a bit of
work to anyone maintaining a kernel driver package.

It seems to me that as long as the GPU architecture hasn't been
modified (I don't think I've ever encountered such a case) then
it has to be a standard ARM Mali type regardless of the SoC
vendor.  So unless a Mali-T820 in the Amlogic S912 SoC is not the
same as a T820 in a different SoC, please forgive me but I don't
understand why a vendor compatible string is needed.  My main
concern is that it's going to be very hard to keep that list
up-to-date with all existing Midgard SoC variants.  If do we need
to add vendor compatible strings to correctly describe the
hardware then I'm happy to add the amlogic one in my patch v3; I
would just like to understand why that's necessary.


Thanks,
Guillaume
