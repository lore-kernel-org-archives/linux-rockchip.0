This was one of my worries as well, which is why the flag exists in the first 
place, right now offloading the requirement to check for such conflict cases to 
the clock-tree creator.


I think one possible test to add could be to check for conflicts between 
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT and this new flag.

Aka in clk-init once encountering the CLK_KEEP_REQRATE, go up through parent 
clocks as long as CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT is set and if we encounter a parent 
with num_children > 1 (aka a shared base-clock, like a PLL on rockchip) 
unset CLK_KEEP_REQRATE, as it would like introduce that ping-pong game.

Hmm, although this test would also fire in cases like Rockchip's fractional 
dividers, where there is the common pll-select-mux+divider and after that 
the mux selecting between that or having the fractional-divider in between 
as well.

I guess it can get hairy to detect such cases sucessfully.

It's more like what would you want to do in the error/failure cases.

So far I was going by the assumption we're going to change the clock anyway 
and just try to pull marked clocks along, so in the error case it would just 
fall back to the current behaviour.
