A real, working patch would be nice. FWIW, when I try the following
diff, my PCIe WiFi dies gloriously:

Are you sure the PCIe controller can't know? I'm pretty sure it has kno=
w
how many lanes are in use. And your controller even has this coded in
it:

	status =3D pcie_read(port, PCIE_CORE_CTRL_MGMT_BASE);
	status =3D  0x1 << ((status >> PCIE_CORE_PL_CONF_LANE_SHIFT) &
			   PCIE_CORE_PL_CONF_LANE_MASK);
	dev_dbg(port->dev, "current link width is x%d\n", status);

So, doesn't that mean that out of lanes {0, 1, 2, 3}, that every lane
other than 0 <=3D lane < width is unused? So you can just disable those=
,
and have the same effect as the rockchip_pcie_phy_laneoff() function?
