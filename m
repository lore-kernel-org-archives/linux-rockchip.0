there are always more things to control (reset pins, regulators) and the usb 
subsystem is currently in the process of getting support for such "embedded" 
uses.

Just to make sure we're not talking about different things. This was meant 
to illustrate that even though core layouts often look similar we should not 
try to connect different product board files unnecessarily, as the small 
differences will make everything more complicated.

The "reload" definitly is a completely different product that only shares 
the manufacturer (firefly) and the soc (rk3288) with the other product and 
as I wrote should get its own independent dts file.


If anything you could do a split into a reload-core dtsi for the system-on-
module part and a baseboard dts that includes that (something like what is 
done for rk3288-rock2).

no problem, always nice to have more people play with Rockchip stuff on a 
mainline kernel :-)
