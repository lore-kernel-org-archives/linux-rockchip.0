I wasn't sure how ACPI did this when I first suggested Rockchip take
this approach, but since then I believe have figured it out. We have:

pci_prepare_to_sleep() -> pci_enable_wake()

where pci_enable_wake() will configure PME wakeup and/or "platform" wake
(which presumably is the WAKE# signal). pci-acpi.c has registered hooks
for the latter via pci_set_platform_pm().

This doesn't really make it any more generic for discovering this
platform-specific detail. We'd have to set up some kind of platform ops
that could be shared for any DT-based platforms.

But that *does* answer the question I had about conditionality: should
we always enable WAKE# for platforms that have the pin hooked up to the
host? Or is this configured on a per-device basis? IIUC, the intention
is that there's only a single open-drain WAKE# pin for the whole system,
and it's just pulled high for EPs that don't implement it.

Quite possibly. Or everyone just sidestepped this an configured the pin
elsewhere (e.g., you could stick a GPIO like this into a gpio-keys
device and it would mostly work).

It looks like the infrastructure is in pci_set_platform_pm(), sort of.
But that still doesn't help you for the repetition; you're just lucky
you only have 2 controller drivers that call this right now :)

Side note: there's some dissonance between this statement, in
Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst:

"Device drivers, however, are not expected to call
:c:func:`device_set_wakeup_enable()` directly in any case."

Yet:

$ git grep -l device_set_wakeup_enable drivers/ | wc -l
69

And particularly, I believe that was necessary for Wifi drivers like
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/wow.c.
