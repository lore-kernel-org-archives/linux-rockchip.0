Sigh, the "i" in iATU doesn't stand for "inbound", does it... major 
brain fart there.

Yeah, that one pretty much settles it - we can certainly expect host 
root ports with nonzero device numbers, so that's at least 13 bits of 
the StreamID space to cover, which isn't going to fly.

Agreed; FWIW, for the patch as it is:
