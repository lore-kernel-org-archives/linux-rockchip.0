Untile now, none of my(and my colleagues') rockchip platforms are able
to reproduce this issue, so I can't tell what exactly the problem is.
However, I noticed you mentioned that the Exynos platforms are also
affected by rpm of dwmmc. I don't see dw_mmc-exynos enable this feature,
so it looks quite odd to me!

Can I or Eddie get a Veyron board to help you debug it?
