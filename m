OK, I'm OK with this, but I'd like to get Heiko's opinion.

Also:
* Just for kicks, does mdelay(1) work?  I know that's 100x more than
udelay(10), but previously we were actually looping waiting for the
power domain, right?  ...so maybe the old code used to introduce a
pretty big delay.

* Does anyone from the chip design team have any idea why patch set #4
works but patch set #2 doesn't?  I know it's Sunday morning in China
right now, but maybe you could ask Monday?


Thanks!
