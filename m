This adds new config accessor functions to struct pci_ops and makes
the callers responsible for figuring out which one to use.  The
benefit is to reduce code duplication in some host bridge drivers
(DesignWare and MVEBU so far).

From a design perspective, I'm not comfortable with moving this burden
from the host bridge drivers to the callers of the config accessors.

The pci_ops struct is a pretty low-level thing, but it is declared in
include/linux/pci.h and while I think it's ugly to use it outside the
PCI core, there's nothing that actually prevents that, and there are
several places that do use it, including at least the ones below.  We
could argue that many of these don't need updating because they don't
need .read_bridge() accessors, but I don't think pci_ops users should
be making assumptions like that.
