=46or a specific Soc, it's the basic rule to make sure the internal del=

yes, 0/90/180/270 is very accurate and mainline kernel use phase offset
for these four phase.

Right. We care hold time here.

Have your code touched them? I check the TRM and find it should be 180
always.

Also for rk3036/3368/3399/3228.... the reset vaule is 180...

maybe. But I think 180(downside) is the better.

 From tons of test on rockchip products which always use 180, I didn't
see failure. Hardcoding it doesn't look so decent maybe... but anyway
it works.

I'm sure all the rockchip Socs defaultly use 180 for drv_phase if I got
the right TRMs these years.

Anyway let me check it with my ASIC team and I will let you know
the result.


Thanks.
