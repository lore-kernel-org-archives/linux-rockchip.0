I see. Thanks a lot for your explanations. I just asked because
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED only prevents the clock to be disabled by
clk_disable_unused() but still can be disabled if a driver explicitly
looks it up and calls clk_disable() or if the clock is affected by
other clocks.

But I understand now that both scenarios are not possible. So yes,
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED is more suitable in this case.
