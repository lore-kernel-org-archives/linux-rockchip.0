I was actually going to suggest the same change. I don't mind if the
name isn't explicit about this being an override. The important thing is
that we document this as being an override.

I've thought about that, but I think that'd be putting too much of a
burden on the panel drivers and/or display drivers. In the simplest case
it may be sufficient to restrict the pixel clock, in which case it would
be fairly easy for the driver to adjust the other parameters.

But what if you also need to restrict the porches. At some point it'll
become very difficult for the driver to automatically determine which of
the other parameters to adjust and how. Chances are that whoever needs
to deal with the restrictions already knows how to adjust the parameters
to fixup the mode.

I think this gives us a nice balance of simplicity when people don't
care (they'd just use the typical timings) and flexibility when they do
(adjust the mode to take into account display driver restrictions and
completely specify the mode if the restrictions are too complicated for
code to realistically apply them).
