Some of the host drivers have the requirement of knowing whether the
EP would never train at some link speed at all. For instance, on some
boards, the link won't train at 5 GT/s but the host driver still sacrifice
some cycle to wait for the resule of training at 5 GT/s as the host could
actually support 5 GT/s. So we could parse this new property and make the
host drivers be aware of these cases.
