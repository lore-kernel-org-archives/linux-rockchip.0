OK.
The dying processor to execute v7_exit_coherency_flush(),not that the=20
dying processor to be in WFI/WFE.

It's needed to enter WFI/WFE state from the ARM refer document when CPU=
=20
down.

But......

Here is my test: (won't to enter the WFI state)
@@ -331,8 +331,8 @@ static int rockchip_cpu_kill(unsigned int cpu)
  static void rockchip_cpu_die(unsigned int cpu)
  {
         v7_exit_coherency_flush(louis);
-       while (1)
-               cpu_do_idle();
+       while (1);
+               //cpu_do_idle();
  }

echo 1 > /sys/power/pm_print_times
echo mem > sys/power/state

You can play anything
or do some test for CPU up/down:

cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/
for i in $(seq 10000); do
   echo "=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D $i =3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D"
   for j in $(seq 100); do
     while [[ "$(cat cpu1/online)$(cat cpu2/online)$(cat cpu3/online)"=20
!=3D "000" ]]; do

       echo 0 > cpu1/online
       echo 0 > cpu2/online
       echo 0 > cpu3/online
     done
     while [[ "$(cat cpu1/online)$(cat cpu2/online)$(cat cpu3/online)"=20
!=3D "111" ]]; do
       echo 1 > cpu1/online
       echo 1 > cpu2/online
       echo 1 > cpu3/online
     done
   done
done
Sometimes,the system will be restart when do the about test.
I'm no sure what's happen, That maybe abnormal won't to enter the WFI=20
state.
