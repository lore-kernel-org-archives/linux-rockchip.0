This would create that cpufreq-dt device on all non-Rockchip platforms=20
compiled into the same kernel image as well - we definitly don't want t=
hat.

Also, on both the rk3368 as well as the rk3399, you probably want the c=
luster-
handling of arm-bL-cpufreq-dt.
Contrary to its name it is _not_ limited to switching between clusters,=
 but=20
can also control frequencies of multiple cpu-clusters running at the sa=
me=20
time.


Implementation-wise, I guess doing it similar to the scpi-implementatio=
n might=20
make more sense. Please take a look at drivers/clk/clk-scpi.c that regi=
sters=20
the virtual cpufreq device there.

So we could do something similar, move the cpufreq from mach-rockchip t=
o the=20
clock drivers and register the appropriate cpufreq-driver for each soc.
cpufreq-dt for socs with a single cluster, the bL-thing for socs with m=
ultiple=20
clusters.
