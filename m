Yes, I agreed this point.

This changes purely based on the recent changes on naming conventions
that have been followed in amlogic and allwinner with regards to
libretech [1]. I have seen few Bananapi boards from Allwinner H3 has
been converted as per Libretech computer recently. I assume these
changes are because libretech has part of co-designed vendor and also
open source forum supported for these hardware.

For further information, may be Da Xue can comment on this.
