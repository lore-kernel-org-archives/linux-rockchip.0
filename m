Great, so let's limit it to 0/90/180/270 for the drive phase offset.
We don't need lots of precision for the drive phase offset (right?)
and accuracy is more important.

Sure, it can be SoC specific.  ...though at the moment, I'd bet that
you can come up with a single rule for the drive phase offset that
will work for every Rockchip SoC produced so far, especially if you
are using only 0/90/180/270.  I'd imagine that they all have similar
enough internal delays.

As per above, let's not use delay line for drive delay.  On all
Rockchip SoCs that I have seen it's possible to make 0/90/180/270 very
accurately.  That means no board-to-board differences.  Current
mainline Linux kernel source code will always make 0/90/180/270 using
phase offset (not delay line).

For sampling we use tuning and using the delay elements makes some
sense (since 90 degrees is not quite accurate enough to fully tune
UHS).  ...but for driving where the only requirement is hold times we
don't need delay elements.

Right, most Rockchip platforms simply don't touch this and it works
OK.  ...but I don't think it defaults to 180.  Grepping through on my
veyron (rk3288) device shows

       sdio1_drv - 90
       sdio0_drv - 90
       sdmmc_drv - 90
       emmc_drv -180

...and, as we've seen, these values appear to be 270 on some other SoCs.


The claim from the Designware Databook says that SDR104 and SDR12, and
identification mode need 180 degrees to work properly.  It would be
interesting to hook up rk3288 to a signal analyzer and see hold times
are OK or if we need to move up to 180 degrees for those modes.

Note that the Designware Databook assumes "Delay_O" of 1.4ns.  If
yours is shorter then maybe 90 degrees is OK for those modes?


Also: I still haven't heard whether there is any downside to using 180
degrees for modes that only require 90 degrees.  Does it cause
problems to just always use 180 degrees?  If not, we could possibly
use 180 degrees everywhere and just hardcode it?


...but if 180 is ideal everywhere, can you answer:

* Why does dw_mmc manual spend so much time talking about it?  It
could just say "set to 180 degrees".

* Why do Rockchip SoCs default to values that are not 180 degrees?
