The counter is allowed to be clocked at a different rate, as long as it
is incremented by the frequency ratio on each tick of the new frequency.
In your case, the counter should increment by 750 on each tick of the
32kHz clock. If the rk3399 implementation doesn't do this, then this is
a bug, and we need a quirk to work around it.

Note that such a quirk will have some other impacts, such as the
gettimeofday implementation in the VDSO (which relies on the counter
making forward progress). There could be other issues in the timer
subsystem as well... This doesn't look like a pleasant thing to fix.

Thanks,
