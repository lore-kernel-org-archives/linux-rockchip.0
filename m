I believe Emil is mostly correct. We only are using a BTN_LEFT in our
copy of the driver, and I'm not sure the others are connected to
anything. As Dmitry has explained to me (when I also wondered about
"detect[ing] the proper keymap"), we don't exactly "auto"discover
things; we just heuristically determine the configurations we know are
used on Chrome devices.

So from the sound of it, this keymap property is reasonable. I haven't
actually checked what our driver "auto" detects on gru-kevin, but if
this works then I'll bet it's correct :)

IOW, I don't know enough to ACK this patch, but I'm certainly not going
to NAK it.
