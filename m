I assume you meant the _above_ test.  So it sometimes works and
sometimes doesn't?  Strange...

Good test.  I think I understood what you said above: basically if you
don't get to the WFI state then the system will sometimes restart.

I guess that seems a little strange to me since I would have thought
that since you assert "reset" to the CPU before you power it off it
wouldn't matter a whole lot what state the system was in.  The
processor has exited concurrency and isn't touching any memory, so
nothing it does should be hurting anyone.  ...but I also am only
guessing about how all this works / trying to use common sense.  If we
really need to be in WFI/WFE then I guess that's what we need to do.

It still makes me nervous to say both that we "need to be in WFI" and
that we have a loop around cpu_do_idle().  The loop implies that
cpu_do_idle() might return sometimes.  That would be OK, except now
we've learned that if we happen to kill the CPU while we're executing
the loop that it might crash the system.  That's pretty non-ideal.  I
know the chances are incredibly unlikely, but still something that
worries me...
