This clock is only needed when doing video output (like eDP), right?
That means it is not really a critical clock.  Critical clocks are
supposed to be ones that are needed for the basic functioning of the
system and that can never be turned off in any circumstances.  In this
case, if someone were running a rk3399 device and didn't have any
video output they would want this clock off.

Can you figure out in exactly which circumstances this clock needs to
be on and then add a proper consumer of this clock?  For instance, if
this clock is needed whenever the VOP is outputting data, then the VOP
should be a client and should turn this clock on and off when video is
being output.  If this clock is needed whenever you access VOP
registers, then the VOP should be a client and turn this clock on
around register accesses.
