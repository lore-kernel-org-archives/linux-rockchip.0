It's not that effective, doing that change on a per-board level - as it
would possibly need to be repeated for future boards.
The i2s driver doesn't care, as it uses named clocks, so I instead did
the swap in the rk3036.dtsi for all boards. Can you check if that is ok
for you or if I did overlook something?


Thanks

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: swap i2s clock ordering on rk3036

For sound setups using the simple-card mechanism, the main clock
(sysclk) is expected to be the first element. For the i2s-driver
itself it doesn't matter, as it uses named clocks, so we can just
swap them.
