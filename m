Hi Linus,

I'm not sure I follow all of Thomas's suggestions on what should be done
in the future yet, but I agree that can be done in parallel:

Can we consider this an "ack" for the $subject then? Heiko also gave his
approval. How can this get merged? It's running a bit late for 4.12,
though it really shouldn't be risky (at least for non-RT stuff that was
working warning-free already in 4.11), but a 4.13-rc1 with -stable tag
could work as well.

I suppose I didn't put a proper 'Fixes' tag (though it should be obvious
from the commit message), so here goes:

Fixes: 88bb94216f59 ("pinctrl: rockchip: avoid hardirq-unsafe functions in irq_chip")

Regards,
Brian
