I didn't get cc:ed the series, but only the last part, which makes it
bit hard to get the full context.

Moreover, it would be good if you explained a bit more on what the
above series actually does and why. Also I don't get why is the PM
domain changes is in the series, as this seems to be about devfreq.

My point is, if you want me to review, please try to be more precise
so I know what to review.
