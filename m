I came up with the following (untested) patch. Please let me know if th=

works for you.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] drivers/perf: arm-pmu: Handle per-interrupt affinity m=
ask

On a big-little system, PMUs can be wired to CPUs using per CPU
interrups (PPI). In this case, it is important to make sure that
the enable/disable do happen on the right set of CPUs.

Do this by querying the corresponding cpumask on the corresponding
paths
