You mean userspace compatibility? If yes, then the affected boards are using
MRAA library for providing the userspace access and I will ensure that it will
get updated to the new labels.

But for other userspace scripts which users might be depending on, it will
break for sure. So, I would like to get some feedback here from Rob.
