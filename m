     Actually, I have two boards on my hand, one uses uart0 as debug 
port and the another uses uart2, so I add all of them here.

    I have a question here, I not very clear how to get the 
DEBUG_UART_VIRT value here,  I now set the value I got from uart driver 
and it works , is there some rule or  method to calculate this 
DEBUG_UART_VIRT value on different platform?
