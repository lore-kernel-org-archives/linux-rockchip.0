Similar comments to patch set #1 about sort ordering.

...I'll also notice that if we do end up setting the "critical" to 100
C for most of veyron then I guess we'll have to switch it back to 90 C
here for speedy to match downstream?  Maybe that's an argument for
doing it in this patchset so we don't forget?  I'm somewhat amazed
that downstream has only 10 C between "alert" and 'critical" for GPU
for speedy, but I guess it's OK?
