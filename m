Hi Thierry,

I'm trying to get these "atomic PWM config" and "initial PWM state
retrieval" stuff in for at least 3 releases. I can understand that some
things have to be discussed and reworked in order to be good enough for
mainline, but that's not what I'm seeing here.

You and Mark raised some concerns about the usage of the
pwm_{get,set}_default_xxx() helpers which I tried to address by
proposing something else. I asked you to comment on it a few weeks ago,
but you never did.
You also told me that you would search for an alternative solution, but
never came back to me.

So I think it's now time to take a decision, whether you want to take
this series with some minor reworks (changing function names to clarify
what is a default and current PWM state), or decide that you expect
something else (but in that case I'd like you to explain what you want).

And by the way, the behavior you're complaining about is already
currently in place: even if the pwm_get_period() function does not
contain the 'default' word in its name, what's actually returned is the
default (or reference) period (the one retrieved from the DT or the PWM
lookup table) not the period currently in use on the PWM device (the
same goes for other helpers).

Can we please settle on something for 4.6 so that I can repost a series
when 4.5-rc1 is out?

Thanks,

Boris
