True. We have a binding with no users in the kernel. I think we should
move in the direction of using it though. After all, it should not be
a question of fbdev vs. DRM support for the binding. Connectors are
certainly a concept within DRM, but they are very closely tied to
encoder/bridge drivers ATM. We should be able to separate them to
handle the common cases, but we have to have some consistency across
DT bindings to do that. I don't yet have more concrete proposals
though.

Yes, that is fairly common (ADV75xx is same), and we would not
describe an I2C bus in DT in that case. Same with HPD directly handled
vs. a GPIO line. That is no different than what Doug has said:
ddc-i2c-bus is present if using the SOC's I2C host and absent if using
the HDMI block's DDC functionality. I'm only questioning the location
of the property.

Even if the bridge handles DDC and HPD, there is also regulator
control for the connector power supply. That's most likely never going
to be part of the bridge.

Agreed.
