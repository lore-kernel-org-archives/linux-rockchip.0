As I say, I tested on v4.4, I don't back port
arch/arm64/kernel/perf_event.c, so I use "arm,cortex-a57-pmu". Upstream
will use "arm,cortex-a72-pmu" only.
BTW, I don't see any differences between A72/A57 in source code:

static int armv8_a57_pmu_init(struct arm_pmu *cpu_pmu)
{
        armv8_pmu_init(cpu_pmu);
        cpu_pmu->name                   =3D "armv8_cortex_a57";
        cpu_pmu->map_event              =3D armv8_a57_map_event;
        cpu_pmu->pmu.attr_groups        =3D armv8_pmuv3_attr_groups;
        return armv8pmu_probe_num_events(cpu_pmu);
}

static int armv8_a72_pmu_init(struct arm_pmu *cpu_pmu)
{
        armv8_pmu_init(cpu_pmu);
        cpu_pmu->name                   =3D "armv8_cortex_a72";
        cpu_pmu->map_event              =3D armv8_a57_map_event;
        cpu_pmu->pmu.attr_groups        =3D armv8_pmuv3_attr_groups;
        return armv8pmu_probe_num_events(cpu_pmu);
}

static const struct of_device_id armv8_pmu_of_device_ids[] =3D {
=2E..
        {.compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a57-pmu",    .data =3D armv8_a57_p=
mu_init},
        {.compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a72-pmu",    .data =3D armv8_a72_p=
mu_init},
=2E..
        {},
};

I also set interrupt-affinity, maybe this avoid problem. I add some
debug print on driver, I believe irq is request on right cpus.
