I just want to make sure, people can actually create a working system
with this, as there is mainline u-boot support for the rk3228/rk3229 in
the works - hopefully also with SPL support later on.
So I'm wondering how this is supposed to be setup?

On arm64 we now have the SPL load the ATF, which in turn loads uboot, so I 
guess the mechanism for the op-tee would be somehow similar? And there all 
necessary components are available to build everything from source.

I really don't care about all the other super-secret stuff happening in
that op-tee thingy, but I really want people to be able to build a complete
firmware on their machine, without having to rely on arbitary binary blobs.

Which is something companies adopting Rockchip socs seem to rely on
a lot these days ;-) .


One alternative I can think of, would be to also create a u-boot psci 
implementation for arm32, like sunxi [0] and others use for example.
That way people could choose where their psci should come from (u-boot
itself or the op-tee).
