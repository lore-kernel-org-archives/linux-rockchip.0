Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below clock changes for 4.7. As the tag explains it is mainly
the rk3399 support + necessary plumbing.

So if it looks ok, please pull.


Thanks
Heiko

  clk: rockchip: add clock controller for the RK3399 (2016-03-28 14:57:07 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
This is first big chunk of Rockchip clock-related changes for 4.7.

Main change is probably the added support for the new rk3399 soc
and necessary infrastructure changes surrounding it.

The biggest chunk is probably that clock code is now able to
handle multiple clock providers in one system, as the rk3399
has two of those. A general one and another smaller one in a
separate power domain. The rk3399 also uses another new pll type.
Thankfully it just fits nicely into our current structure.
It also needs some parts like the cpuclk mux parameters to be
a bit more flexible and an new fractional divider subtype without
gate.

Apart from this big change we have some more fixes and removal
of forgotten variables.
