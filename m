I don't have a Tinker Board, but the symptom sounds instantly familiar 
from hacking on another RK3288 box; have you tried adding 
"regulator-always-on" to the vccio_sd regulator?

With the reference design (which I would assume the Tinker Board has no 
reason to deviate from in this area), the CD pin is either wired 
directly to the SoC with no external pull-up, or explicitly pulled up to 
VCCIO_SD. Either way, when the dwmmc driver probes and discovers there 
is no card present, it sets the currently-unnecessary vqmmc-supply as 
inactive, and thus the regulator core turns off VCCIO_SD entirely. 
Unfortunately, this removes the voltage from the entire I/O domain 
including the internal pull-up, which ends up leaving the CD pin 
floating and generating spurious events.
