One reason for why I didn't add error handling is that
maybe we could add a very large timeout value for this, and
the system could be broken anyway if it does need such a long
time for a peripheral IP to write memory. But you are right maybe, it
is not a good idea to do that. I will propgate a error and let it
fall back to PIO mode.

Thanks.
