I saw you talking with Shawn in the other thread on doing this in a 
different way, but that statement itself is incorrect and should not land in 
the kernel.

At least rk3066/rk3188 (and most likely earlier) do not support the tuning 
at all and the drive-clock is going through a static non-controllable 
inverter (according to the CRU docs), so should always be at 180 degrees.
