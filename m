UHS_REG_EXT is acutally "reserved" on both the rk3288 as well as the rk=
3368.=20
rk3036/rk3128 (Cortex-A7) provide a bit description, but the tuning=20
documentation still uses the controls located in the clock controller.

So I guess UHS_REG_EXT is the real "generic" solution.

As described above, moving that to the rockchip part sounds sensible. A=
nd I=20
guess we can think more about it, once a second user appears.
