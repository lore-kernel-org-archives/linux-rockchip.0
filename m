Well, if it were to be removed from the TRM then that would be a
strong sign that the SoC designers think that this clock should never
ever be turned off.  If that were the case I don't think I could
object to leaving this clock on all the time.  Presumably then we'd
totally remove the clock from the clock tree and rely on firmware to
leave it on?  Technically removing this clock is not really
device-tree backward compatible, but I guess if there are no current
users...

=2E..note: if the clock IS listed in the TRM and there's ever a chance
that we'd want to turn it off, it's much easier to set that up all
now.  Trying to later go in and decide that these clocks are no longer
"always on" gets into all sorts of weird device tree backward
compatibility corner cases.
