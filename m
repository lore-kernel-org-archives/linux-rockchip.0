I'm not sure we can really answer that question ("why do no other PCI
bindings have this?"). But one guess would be that every other
controller uses only beacon wake.

It would be OK with me if we made a blanket statement that a controller
with a "wake" interrupt means PCI WAKE# (per the specification). It's
possible this could even be stuck into some generic PCI/DT code
eventually. (I don't think we have a really good place for this today.)
