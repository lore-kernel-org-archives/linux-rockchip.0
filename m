Yes, it's the correct behaviour. The 4 PHYs is abstraction of 4 lanes
for per-lane PHY mode, but for legacy PHY mode, PHY represents a single
component managing 4 lanes together. So no matter how many lanes are
used, we couldn't call phy_power_off for legacy PHY mode until we really
want to power off the PHY. That is  why we need to recontruct the pcie
and phy driver to migrate to per-lane PHY mode as we could treat each
lane as a phy object and let phy driver do idling work in the
phy_power_off callback instead of power-off work if ref count isn't
decreased to zero.

Also I think the key point here is that for legacy PHY mode, only
phys[0] is vaild, so there is no difference if we call phy_power_off for
phys[1..3] as you did, because PHY API will check the phy object and
won't do anything if seeing invalid/NULL phy object. So changing 
lanes_map from 0x1 to 0xf is only silent the "idling lane x" log.
