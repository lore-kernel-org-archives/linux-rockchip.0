I'd like to pose a question for people to think about.

Firstly, typedefs are generally shunned in the kernel.  However, for
these cases it seems to make sense.

However, should the "pointer"-ness be part of the typedef or not?  To
see what I mean, consider:

	typedef void (*hdmi_foo)(void);

	int register_foo(hdmi_foo foo);

vs

	typedef void hdmi_foo(void);

	int register_foo(hdmi_foo *foo);

which is more in keeping with how we code non-typedef'd code - it's
obvious that foo is a pointer while reading the code.

It seems to me that the latter better matches what is in the kernel's
coding style, which states:

  In general, a pointer, or a struct that has elements that can
  reasonably be directly accessed should **never** be a typedef.

or maybe Documentation/process/coding-style.rst needs updating?
