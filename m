Take corecfg_clockmultiplier as example.
1. sdhci driver fetch host->clk_mul from corecfg_clockmultiplier
2. mmc->f_min and mmc->f_max are calculated via host->clk_mul, they're 
used for further initialization.
3. if the corecfg_clockmultiplier is incorrect, sdhci will use improper 
frequency to play.

I think we don't need to store it due to it's a fixed value at run-time, 
even if it is reset after a power cycle, the above will not be changed 
via software, except for dirver unbind .

Yup, corecfg_* stuff will be reset after a power cycle.
I mean that we need only to guarantee they're correct at probe time.
