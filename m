I assume you are going to use the generic PM domain (genpd)?
If so, this statement isn't entirely correct.

As a matter of fact, the PM domain will be "powered on" once you have
registered your PM domain with genpd and when the device (dw_mmc etc)
gets attached to the domain. The attach occurs when the platform bus'
->probe() function get invoked for the device.

Genpd monitors each device within the domain. To allow it to "power
off", all devices in same domain needs to be runtime PM enabled and
runtime PM suspended.

Due to this, you should be able to deploy genpd support+an updated
DTB, without first having to deploying runtime PM support in the
related drivers. In other words, you should be able to work on these
things almost independently of each other.

To me this isn't necessary to describe for each device. I think
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt describes all
that is needed.

I would rephrase these commit message headers, to something like
"Deploy runtime PM support", as that is actually what you intend to
do.
