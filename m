The suspend/resume name are already used as pair function name.
I think that devfreq_suspend/resume_device() are appropriate.

Usually, '_runtime_put/get' naming means the 'runtime PM' callback function
which handle the all of resource (e.g., clock, regulator, register and so o=
n).

Sure. I'm waiting your patch.
