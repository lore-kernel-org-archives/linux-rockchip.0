Yesterday I made a test run and the TL;DR is this:

Tested-by: Diederik de Haas <diederik@cknow-tech.com>  # Rock64, RockPro64, Quartz64-B

The longer version ...

Test setup:
I have a 1080p monitor capable of HDMI 1.4 (I think) and a 4K TV capable of
HDMI 2.0 (but not 2.1). I'm running Debian Testing/Sid on them with Sway
1.12-rc3-1 (from Experimental) and see if that works (at all) and then I try to
play one or more of my 'test' videos with mpv and using v4l2request HW accel.
I used 2 kernels: 7.1-rc3 and 7.1-rc3 with this patch set.

One of the possible issues that may have been fixed with this patch set is
doing hotplugging of the HDMI connection, especially going from 4K to 1080p.
So when testing I unplugged my 4K cable and plugged in the 1080p cable and
looked if it has adjusted things properly. I also checked dmesg to see if
there were interesting msgs.

When I was preparing my testing session the 'Sent hotplug event' caught my eye
as it seemed like a clear differentiator between the kernel with and without
this patch set.
Unfortunately during my 'real' testing session I did not see that message ...

... but I did see all the others. With my 4K TV I got
``max TMDS clock 300000 kHz``
but on my 1080p monitor I got 0 kHz just like quoted above.

I also checked CEC and EDID with the following commands:
- ``cat /sys/kernel/debug/cec/cec0/status``
- ``di-edid-decode /sys/devices/platform/display-subsystem/drm/card0/card0-HDMI-A-1/edid``

And in all cases they produced identical outputs.

Rock64 testing:

On the Rock64 I got a stack trace:

```

This was with the kernel *with* this patch set (and connected to 4K TV; no
idea if that's relevant though).
But I did not see any adverse affects from it and when I tried again today,
I did NOT get a/that stack trace.

The Rock64 was the device which showed most clearly the difference between
having this patch set applied or not.
As always, I started with the kernel without this patch set and booted it up
connected to my 4K TV. Then I logged into a Sway session via greetd (thus ~
also Sway) and everything looked fine*.
I then tried hotplugging the HDMI from my 4K TV to my 1080p monitor ... and I
did NOT get any output on my monitor. I didn't even see any message in dmesg
that it noticed that first a cable got unplugged and later another cable got
plugged. My monitor itself did notice when I then unplugged the cable again.
When I then plugged the 4K cable back in, my TV showed Sway like before and
AFAICT everything was working again.

When I booted into the kernel WITH this patch set, hotplugging back and forth
worked absolutely fine :-D The screen resolution got adjusted to the new one
and dmesg noticed the unplugging and plugging actions and it showed similar
messages as Jonas showed in his cover page (and quoted above).
With the exception of 'Sent hotplug event' as mentioned above.

*) There are pretty substantial artifacts which are AFAIUI due to the
not-exactly-fast GPU and memory, but that's unrelated to this patch set.
Playing a HW accelerated video full-screen often works pretty decently.

RockPro64 testing:

I can be much shorter about the RockPro64.
Everything seemed to work just fine with and without this patch set applied. So
no improvement, but also no regressions.

Quartz64-B testing:

Same story as with RockPro64: no improvements, but also no regressions.
I did notice that ``drm.debug=0xe`` was *quite* verbose on this device.
On Rock64 and RockPro64 I saw various drm related msgs in dmesg _when I
actually did something_ but on Q64-B I got several ~ identical lines per
second, whether I did sth or not. But that was with and without this patch
set, so I guess that's a general RK356X 'issue' (if at all an issue).

Cheers,
  Diederik
