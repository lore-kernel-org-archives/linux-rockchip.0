Why would you think that? It would just mean moving the pinctrl 
selection down to the board level like for GPIOs - we manage just fine 
with a single DT node per GPIO bank, and semantically PWMs have no 
reason do be different. In fact on newer SoCs some PWM channels can be 
muxed to multiple pins, so pinctrl really has to be at the board level 
already in those casesa.

The TRMs seem pretty clear that the "new" PWM block from RK3288 onwards 
is a single module with 4 channels, not 4 independent controllers, so it 
seems to have been an unfortunate mistake not to create a new binding 
for it at that point. It would be a little fiddly, but far from 
impossible, to make the driver support both the existing binding and a 
new one (and I don't see how we could use the interrupt on newer SoCs 
*without* a binding change, given that the interrupt status register is 
outside any channel's current "reg"), but an old kernel with a new DT 
would be more problematic. If we kept the existing compatibles then an 
old driver would always use channel 0 regardless of what the consumer 
requested; using new compatibles as well means the old kernel loses PWM 
functionality entirely, which is arguably "safe", but I'm not sure if 
it's really better or worse :/
