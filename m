By default, dw_mmc-rockchip will execute tuning for each degree.
So we won't miss every point of the good sample windows. However,
probably the phases are linear inside the good sample window.
Actually we don't need to do tuning for each degree so that we could
save some time, for instance, probe the driver or resume from S3.
