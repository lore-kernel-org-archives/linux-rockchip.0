In fact, this is similar to what we do in the downstream kernel. 
The complete decision flow is as follows[0]:

if (vop_bw_info->plane_num_4k || crtc_num > 1 ||
	crtc->state->adjusted_mode.crtc_hdisplay > 2560 ||
	crtc->state->adjusted_mode.crtc_vdisplay > 2560 ||
	linedur_ns < 7500) {/* 4kp60 linedur_ns roughly equal to 7500 ns */
	
	/* set aclk to 750M */
	funcs->set_aclk(crtc, ROCKCHIP_VOP_ACLK_ADVANCED_MODE, vop_bw_info);
	priv->aclk_adjust_frame_num = 2;
}

I think the condition above should be equivalent to the
"linedur_ns < 7500" here :)
