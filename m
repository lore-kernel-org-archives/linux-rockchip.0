The important part is that having only arm,mali-midgard in the
gpu node is not enough to accurately describe the hardware, which
is why it is not listed in the required compatible strings.  On
the other hand, it does help with describing the hardware, so
it's fine to use it.  If people find this confusing then I guess
we could add something to say that arm,mali-midgard can be used
optionally in addition to the specific ones.

Also, if you look at the 64-bit ARM CPUs for example, they
typically have armv8 in their node although armv8 is not
mentioned anywhere in the bindings documentation...
