This is a problem, and checking whether the link is up is a workaround but =
not a real solution.  That means your system may hang if the link happens t=
o go down at the wrong time.

A real solution would be to handle the synchronous external abort so it doe=
sn't cause a system hang.

Yes, I agree that this is workaround. For pcie-xilinx.c for arm32, we can h=
ave fault handling similar to "imx6q_pcie_abort_handler" in drivers/pci/dwc=
/pci-imx6.c.
Since this driver is same for Microblaze architecture also, it requires sep=
arate handling.

For pcie-xilinx-nwl.c ARM64 as per link [1], linux kernel will hang for the=
 above AXI responses.=20
As of now arm64 RAS is still work in progress [2]. =20

[2] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9973967/

The check can be removed, if above issues were addressed.
