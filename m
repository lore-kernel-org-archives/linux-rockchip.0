Hi,

finally got an opportunity to work on this again.

I'll respond to some things in-line. If a review isn't directly
addressed, you can assume I acknowledge it and will address it
in the next revision with no further comment needed.

The counter member is used in the interrupt handler. I actually
noticed that I request the interrupt before pc->counter is set,
so if an interrupt fires before the probe function finishes then
I think the handler would run with a NULL counter member. Oops,
I'll rectify that.

I'm going to read the hardware state in the next revision, you're right
that this is generally a better idea.

In my next revision, I've now modified it to mfpwm_acquire if the hardware
state has the counter enabled during probe. This sounds niche but I'm also
doing this on the PWM output side, where Uwe rightfully pointed out that
a bootloader may have enabled PWM output in hardware and Linux needs to
recognise that state without any heavy-handed actions. For the counter
PWM capture side, resetting it to a known state wouldn't be disruptive in
the same way as it would be for PWM output, but I think it's a good idea
to keep the state as-is since we can read it.

I see what you're going for, but if the counter isn't enabled, we can't
rely in the counter having an mfpwm_acquire, and consequently, we can't
rely on the PWM core clock being on, which is required for reading the
registers.

In my next revision, I'll still be returning 0 if the counter is disabled,
but the is_enabled member is gone, so there's a new function called
rkpwmc_acquire_if_enabled to still make this correct.

I could of course also extend the core driver to let me poke at these
non-shared registers without exclusive control over the hardware, but
that may be more trouble than it's worth.

I'll also no longer return 0 on bogus count IDs when the counter is
disabled.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the hardware allows direct access to
read the signal. "pwm_in" as it appears in the block diagram seems to be
an entirely internal signal that's not accessible through MMIO.

Thank you for the reviews!

Kind regards,
Nicolas Frattaroli
