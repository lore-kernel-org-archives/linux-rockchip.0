I wasn't doubting that. Only that the connection is not to the sdhci block.

Sub-node or not is an orthogonal question. The main part is now we
have a syscon link and we need to power manage the syscon. Or is there
really a need to manage this clock at runtime? Perhaps it can just be
turned on and left on, but that should be in the syscon driver. The
SDHCI driver could retrieve the clocks from syscon node and manage it
directly. I'd be fine with that from a binding perspective, but seems
a bit hacky from a kernel perspective.
