I proposed devm_clk_prepare_enable() and friends (see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/14/544), but Stephen did not like it and
mentioned that he and Mike were working on a different solution where
clk_put() would drop all enables. I have not seen any updates on that
though. Maybe we should revisit devm approach?

Thanks.
