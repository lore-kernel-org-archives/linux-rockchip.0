You are right. The first version we wrote is:
    pmu_a53 {
        compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a53-pmu";
        interrupts =3D <GIC_PPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
        interrupt-affinity =3D <&cpu_l0>,
                     <&cpu_l1>,
                     <&cpu_l2>,
                     <&cpu_l3>;
    };

    pmu_a72 {
        compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a72-pmu";
        interrupts =3D <GIC_PPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
        interrupt-affinity =3D <&cpu_b0>,
                     <&cpu_b1>;
    };
but unfortunately, the arm pmu driver do not support PPI in two cluster
well,
so we have to replace with this implementation.

Great! So what we can do right now? Wait this feature, and delete
arm-pmu node?

Thanks,
