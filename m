Hi Boris,

Thanks for your review. See below my answers.

That wasn't the idea, I wasn't intended to break something. The idea was
to have a generic device tree parsing function since all the drivers,
except pwm-pxa.c, pwm-cros-ec.c and pwm-clps711x.c, uses the same function
to parse DT bindings. And I think, these 3 drivers could use this way of
parsing, which is not something new, is what all the current PWM drivers
uses (except pwm-pxa.c, pwm-cros-ec.c and pwm-clps711x.c). It is true
I have no RK3399 board to run any tests.

pwm-cross-ec.c it is true that it's period cannot be changed. It is fixed, as
I saw in the driver, at EC_PWM_MAX_DUTY=0xffff. The driver itself won't apply
any PWM state if the period is different from EC_PWM_MAX_DUTY.
For this driver, the PWM bindings were changed (I did a grep by "google,cros-ec-pwm"
and located only:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru-kevin.dts
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru.dtsi
files) and changed the bindings in this series, as follows, patch 7 from this series:

        };
};

The code that was removed requests a PWM, the one that was set in the bindings, and
then set pwm->args.period:
-static struct pwm_device *
-cros_ec_pwm_xlate(struct pwm_chip *pc, const struct of_phandle_args *args)
-{
-	struct pwm_device *pwm;
-
-	if (args->args[0] >= pc->npwm)
-		return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
-
-	pwm = pwm_request_from_chip(pc, args->args[0], NULL);
-	if (IS_ERR(pwm))
-		return pwm;
-
-	/* The EC won't let us change the period */
-	pwm->args.period = EC_PWM_MAX_DUTY;
-
-	return pwm;
-}

The old flow is as follows:
of_pwm_get() -> cros_ec_pwm_xlate() { request chip and set constant period }

The new flow uses of_pwm_xlate():
of_pwm_get() -> of_pwm_xlate() -> { parse PWM args: channel number, period, flags +
request PWM chip + set pwm->args; }

This path is only used at DT parsing.

In case of PWM channel requested by PWM backlight driver it looks good to me
with the changes in rk3399-gru-kevin.dts (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Since this driver accepts only EC_PWM_MAX_DUTY period maybe the documentation should
be updated regarding this value?

Please, let me know what you think!

Thanks,
Claudiu
