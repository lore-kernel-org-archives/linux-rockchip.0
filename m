I'd say let's attribute the authorship to Doug. FTR, the original
downstream Chrome OS patch is https://crrev.com/c/278190.

Not sure if the information in the commit message of the original
patch is relevant for the upstream version, in the end it seems LPM
was never implemented, so it should be sufficient to say what is
actually done today.

In summary, I propose to take the patch with the current commit
message, with Doug as the author. Heiko, can you change the authorship
or should I send a new version?

Doug if you have objections or want updates in the commit message
(yours tend to be more verbose ;-), holler.

Thanks

Matthias
