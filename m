I think core power-domain handling is actually transparent to drivers (aka 
turning on before probe and turning off after remove), see 
drivers/base/platform.c:platform_drv_probe() calling dev_pm_domain_attach() 
with the poweron flag set.

And all the unused domains getting turned off automatically also shouldn't 
hurt us I'd think. Just that someone need to collect all clocks needed for 
the synchronuous reset.
