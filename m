HPC = High Polarity Cycles, LPC = Low Polarity Cycles. They are counted
based on the pwm clock that the hardware runs at. PWMV4_INT_LPC and
PWMV4_INT_HPC are one-bit flags that are raised in the interrupt register
of this hardware when the interrupt is fired, to signal that LPC or HPC
changed state.

Your understanding of the algorithm appears to be correct, from my memory
of when I wrote the code. The 4 captures left logic is because the
hardware needs 4 level transitions before it can provide a useful
number for those two counts; thinking about it more now, I'm surprised it
can't do it in 3, so I'll need to double-check that next time I work on
this.

As an aside note, Rockchip has recently published the RK3506 Technical
Reference Manual, and the RK3506 SoC uses the same PWM IP as the RK3576
for which this driver is for. You can find it here in Chapter 31:

https://opensource.rock-chips.com/images/3/36/Rockchip_RK3506_TRM_Part_1_V1.2-20250811.pdf

This driver specifically implements "31.3.1 Capture Mode", later down
the line I may want to add "31.3.4 Clock Counter", "31.3.5 Clock
Frequency Meter" and "31.3.6 Biphasic Counter" but I lack a proper
signal generator so didn't want to bite off more than I could test.

Basically, any design would work for me. I've only implemented the
counter driver to make sure the PWM reading part of the hardware works,
and Uwe advised me that new PWM drivers should use the counter
subsystem as opposed to implementing the PWM capture operation.

So I think your design makes more sense; any user of this driver would
likely want it to work like the other counter drivers, and exposing
LPC and HPC directly would also let me get rid of the quirky "is the
PWM actually off now" logic.

I'll do this when I get the chance to work on this patch series again,
as it needs a rewrite anyway to plug it into the MFD subsystem.

Thank you for your review and suggestions!

Kind regards,
