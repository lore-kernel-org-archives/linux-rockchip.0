Okay, https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5055741/ that's working for me=

Meanwhile, I change the dts as follows.

-               pinctrl-names =3D "default", "otp_out";
+               pinctrl-names =3D "init", "default";
                 pinctrl-0 =3D <&otp_gpio>;
                 pinctrl-1 =3D <&otp_out>;
