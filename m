I have the feeling we're going quite a bit off-topic right now :-) .
The binary-driver-crazyness, hasn't really anything to do with Yakir's =
support=20
for the RGA (which is about raster-graphics-acceleration, so 2d stuff).

And me mentioning the armsoc-ddx was merely a means to allow some sort =
of=20
different userspace user, as requested in your original mail ;-) .

Maybe you know a better use-case on where to demonstrate the viability =
of the=20
userspace API for it as originally requested.
