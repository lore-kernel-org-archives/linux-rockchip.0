It appears that we need to set the frequency directly with target() functio=
n
at suspend/resume after it is assured that related routines are
already suspended.

Plus, you might need to consider using devfreq_suspend/resume_device instea=
d
of monitor. monitor functions are for the governor-specific behaviors.
You'll need such capabilities regardless of governors. (even userspace-gove=
rnor
needs this)
