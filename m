OK, Regardless of the VPLL and vop.
The current software of clock, there are some problems.
e.p:
[GPLL]
        ------ [div] ----- aclk_perilp
If I set GPLL 1200M use "assigned-clock-rate".My be the default div of 
aclk_perilp is 2, GPLL default freq is 600M.
If I set GPLL first,the aclk_perilp freq will changed as 
300M->600M->300M.But aclk_perilp 600M is a unsafety.It will make the 
system crash.
Aclk_perilp is sizeoff at 300M.It not allowed over frequency.

So if I init the PLL freq use "assigned-clock-rate", I need to list it's 
child clk, make sure it's child clk div is enough,make sure the child 
clk freq is below the  sizeoff freq.

Do you have a better idea for this problem?
