Hi Quentin,

I finally had time to look into this today, and I think I've run into
the same issue you did. Please see the comment below :)

After debugging for a while this is often (not always!) reproducible when DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET=y (but not when built as a module!). The fact it's "not always" is a dead giveaway timing or probe order is involved, more later on that.

pm_runtime_resume_and_get() will fail here because the pmdomain
isn't ready yet.

I think we should return -EPROBE_DEFER in this case.

Considering rdev->cores is allocated based on the number of available nodes in the DTB with the rknn compatible, if rocket_probe() is called more than the number of available nodes, rdev->cores[core] will result in out-of-bounds access.

When I was looking at this code, it hadn't been merged yet,
and there is a core0 device called "rknn_top". Likewise, there's 
a component over there. But in the latest version, it's gone :(

And yes, core 0 is special [0]. So I think this change is make sense.
But that's still not enough, because we may need to defer the probe.
We have to make sure that when we probe next time, core 0 still gets
index 0 here.

>> I can send a patch for that.

>> 3. I believe (but I may be wrong) that core 0 is special (do we need to schedule through core 0 maybe?). There's a hardcoded fetch of the device associated with core 0 via rocket_iommu_domain_create(rdev->cores[0].dev); (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/accel/rocket/rocket_drv.c#L88). The issue is that this assumes that core 0 is always rdev->cores[0], which may not be true as it depends on the probe order (which is not guaranteed), which can be exacerbated by core 0 (HW index) probe being deferred for some reason. Is it necessary for core 0 to be the one initializing the DRM device or could we simply use any core for that (just the first to probe, whichever it actually is HW-wise)?

I agree with you about the probe order problem. As I mentioned, 
in earlier versions core 0 was still "rknn_top". It looks like this
would address many of the problem you raised. I don't know why 
that was dropped in the merged version.

You can use aarch64's default defconfig, then DRM=y, DRM_ACCEL=y and DRM_ACCEL_ROCKET=y via menuconfig. Remember that this is not 100% reproducible (more often happening than not).

>> rknn_core_0 depends on rknn_mmu_0 as highlighted by the iommus phandle property. rknn_mmu_0 depends on RK3588_PD_NPUTOP power-domain. The parent domain (RK3588_PD_NPU) of RK3588_PD_NPUTOP power-domain has a domain-supply on a regulator on i2c (i2c0@42 for Jaguar, patches on the ML at https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20250812085213.1071106-2-heiko@sntech.de/). When the rocket driver calls platform_driver_register() in its module_init() function, the kernel core will try to probe the associated device, via driver_probe_device(), then __driver_probe_device() and more specifically pm_runtime_get_suppliers(dev) in there (https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/base/dd.c#L793). Then this calls pm_runtime_get_sync() on all links, c.f. https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.18-rc7/source/drivers/base/power/runtime.c#L1914. Note that pm_runtime_get_suppliers() returns void. One of the links is the rknn_mmu_0.
>>
>> Follow the next series of function calls, pm_runtime_get_sync() on rknn_mmu_0, rpm_resume(), rpm_callback(), __rpm_callback(). This then calls cb(). cb() is set via RPM_GET_CALLBACK(dev, runtime_resume). Due to rknn_mmu_0 device being probed with dev_pm_domain_attach() attaching the power-domain device to iommu via the pm_domain member, genpd_runtime_resume() (which goes to rockchip_pd_power_on()) is actually called. This then calls rockchip_pd_regulator_enable() which returns -EPROBE_DEFER. Going up in the call stack up to rpm_callback() you can see that retval = __rpm_callback(cb, dev); now is EPROBE_DEFER and thus, dev->power.runtime_error = EPROBE_DEFER at the end of the function.
>>
>> Then once pm_runtime_resume_and_get(dev); is called in rocket_core_init() during probe of the rocket device, it'll call into rpm_get_suppliers() in __rpm_callback() which in turn will call pm_runtime_get_sync() on rknn_mmu_0 which will go up to rpm_resume() where dev->power.runtime_error will be checked and if non-zero will return -EINVAL, effectively eating -EPROBE_DEFER and failing the probe of the rocket device instead of deferring the probe.

I believe that once the problems above are resolved, the complexity
around point 4 will disappear as well.
