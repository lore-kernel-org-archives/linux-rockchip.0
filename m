These look like users, at least at first look. Some elaboration on that
would be good - impact on users definitely should be covered in the
commit message of an ABI break.

FWIW, I don't think you were trying to be dismissive, just trying to
make a valid point about usability being important, but providing clear
justifications for why the order of properties should be changed (or
other similar ABI breaks) is really important. This is v4, and the
rationale you've given here about the documentation, which is the actual
motivation for changing things around, doesn't appear in the commit
message, even after a back and forth with Krzysztof in an earlier
version.

Yeah, you can do this, but to avoid potential breaks you have to do it
=66rom the start, not after the fact. Probably there's bindings that get
acked every day that do do this. Even the retcon is okay to do when
reg-names is mandated by the binding and the users use reg-names in my
opinion.

In this case, the driver is currently buggy, because, as I mentioned, it
uses reg-names without reg-names being required on the platforms with
more than 1 reg property. Probably the binding should make reg-names
mandatory for these platforms even without this patch, but it *has* to
IMO for this proposed change to be applicable.

But anyway, the takeaway from my original mail should be "Conor is not
happy with the rationale the commit message provides for this change,
as it doesn't explain why you want to do it". I necessarily object to
the change itself.
