No, they are actually applied like the e-mail said - please see my git.

In general if you think a fix needs to go in urgently it's best to
specifically identify this.  If nothing is specifically said and it's
not obviously related to something done recently then the tendency will
be to assume that the issue was recently introduced and is a fix for a
development version.

As things stand they'll be merged in the next merge window.  They're
buried in the middle of a branch with other things so I can't just send
the branch as-is.  If these new patches you're talking about are going
to get merged in the merge window as well so we're presumably mostly
fine?
