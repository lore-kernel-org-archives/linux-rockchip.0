I was working on top of next-20180618, quite new :).
However, at least that is a nice hint for me to chase.

Yeah, regulators need another look.

You are looking at a consumer edition board, and this is
the enterprise edition (aka ficus). It has network :)

Here's a nice video where Tom talks about it:

https://youtu.be/2UYcmhbKyP4

FWIW, I have tested mainline U-Boot and Linux. Gigabit network
and mmc tested on both. Also, this board is where I found the
iommu/vpu stall you fixed recently.

Haven't test SATA, but I will soon.
