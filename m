I won't pretend to know what the IC designers were doing, but I don't
think that would resolve the problem I'm talking about. The sequence is
something like:
1. EDGE_BOTH IRQ occurs (e.g., low to high)
2. reconfigure polarity in rockchip_irq_demux() (polarity=low)
3. continue to handle_edge_irq()
4. another HW edge occurs (e.g., high to low)
5. handle_edge_irq() (from 3) acks (clears) IRQ (before a subsequent
   rockchip_irq_demux() gets a chance to run and flip the polarity)
...

Now the polarity is still low, but the next trigger should be a
low-to-high edge.
