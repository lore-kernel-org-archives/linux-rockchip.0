Sorry if it felt that way, it definitely wasn't my intention to shout at
you. Email is indeed kind of a pain to deal with, and I wanted to keep
the discussion going.

It's not clear to me why that test is even running in the first place?
There's been some confusion on my side here about what we're going to
test with this. You've mentioned Mesa and GPUs before, but that's a KMS
test so there must be more to it.

Either way, it's a relevant test so I guess why not. It turns out that
the test is indeed flaky, I guess we could add it to the flaky tests
list.

BUT

I want to have every opportunity to fix whatever that failure is.

So:

  - Is the test broken? If so, we should report it to IGT dev and remove
    it from the test suite.
  - If not, is that test failure have been reported to the driver author?
  - If no answer/fix, we can add it to the flaky tests list, but do we
    have some way to reproduce the test failure?

The last part is especially critical. Looking at the list itself, I have
no idea what board, kernel version, configuration, or what the failure
rate was. Assuming I spend some time looking at the infra to find the
board and configuration, how many times do I have to run the tests to
expect to reproduce the failure (and thus consider it fixed if it
doesn't occur anymore).

Like, with that board and test, if my first 100 runs of the test work
fine, is it reasonable for me to consider it fixed, or is it only
supposed to happen once every 1000 runs?

So, ideally, having some (mandatory) metadata in the test lists with a
link to the bug report, the board (DT name?) it happened with, the
version and configuration it was first seen with, and an approximation
of the failure rate for every flaky test list.

I understand that it's probably difficult to get that after the fact on
the tests that were already merged, but I'd really like to get that
enforced for every new test going forward.

That should hopefully get us in a much better position to fix some of
those tests issues. And failing that, I can't see how that's
sustainable.

And Mesa does show what I'm talking about:

In the history of Mesa, there's never been a single test removed from a

I believe the above would achieve a better result for us kernel folks,
while still providing enough flexibility for you.

I just bought a 7900XT and I'm pretty much in the same situation, so I
definitely feel what you're saying :)

=2E.. I haven't reported any of the failures yet so I don't really expect
them to be fixed by themselves. That's on me.

Just FYI, I'm not on the other side of the fence there, I'd really like
to have some kind of validation. I talked about it at XDC some years
ago, and discussed it several people at length over the years. So I'm
definitely not in the CI-is-bad camp.

That makes sense from your perspective, but it's not clear to me how you
can expect maintainers to own the tests if they were never involved in
the process.

They are not in Cc of the flaky tests patches, they are not reported
that the bug is failing, how can they own that process if we never
reached out and involved them?

We're all overworked, you can't expect them to just look at the flaky
test list every now and then and figure it out.
