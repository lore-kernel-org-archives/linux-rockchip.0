I can confirm what Arnd said. If you have the following interrupt-map
property:

 +    interrupt-map = <0 0 0 1 &pcie0 0>,
 +                    <0 0 0 2 &pcie0 1>,
 +                    <0 0 0 3 &pcie0 2>,
 +                    <0 0 0 4 &pcie0 3>;

Then the hwirq you get in the ->map() function are [ 1 ; 4 ] instead of
the expected [ 0 ; 3 ]. I.e the translation to the interrupt number in
the "target" interrupt controller does not happen.

Now, the question is whether this is a bug *or* whether having
interrupt-map pointing to its own node is not a valid situation.
