The on-board regulators differ and can’t hit the voltages specified
in the original OPP table… this is the next closest value we can
set and is at least what Rockchip uses in the ref-design.

It avoids ugly issues with OPPs being deactivated due to the the
exact voltage used in the “official” OPPs not being supported by
our regulator.

We decided against reusing the original OPP table and modifying it
(to use ranges) as that was likely to cause even more harm in the
long term.

Tested in our lab on a decent population of boards using various
forms of stress-testing (incl. a 6-way and 8-way SPEC).

This one is marked ‘turbo-mode’ as we do recommend to only
enable it if a (Qseven-style) heat-sink is mounted.
