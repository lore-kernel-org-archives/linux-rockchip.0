So I've been told the galaxy nexus and possibly other older TI
hardware used only a string.

And the HTC implementations I've seen have code for both a string and
command to be placed, but usually don't actually copy anything to the
string address (which suggest its not used by the bootloader, as you
note).

Either way, we'd have to extend or implement a new driver, but that's
a bridge I think we can cross later when we see such hardware support
upstream (rather then try to create a super driver that handles
everything a creative firmware developer could come up with).
