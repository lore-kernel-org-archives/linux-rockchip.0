A test with the command below gives for example this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3328-evb.dt.yaml: phy@0:
'#phy-cells' is a required property

The phy nodename is normally used by a phy-handle.
This node is however compatible with
"ethernet-phy-id1234.d400", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22"
which is just been added to 'ethernet-phy.yaml'.
So change nodename to 'ethernet-phy' for which '#phy-cells'
is not a required property

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/
phy/phy-provider.yaml
