the core problem I have right now is, that I don't understand how the
interaction with the dfi controller works at all :-) .

One thing that might work, is that your dfi-driver takes the ddrc-clock
from the clock controller and then registers a clock notifier to get
notified before and after the clock-rate changes. But that depends as
stated above on how the dfi-controller needs to be handled.

For example the current armclk-handling uses a clock notifier around the
actual rate change ... so you could use that as inspiration.
