Sure but I was trying to stay as close as possible to the intended
purpose of the connector on the board as it is sold :-)

Ah it's great to know there has already been something like this because
I thought about developing one for the same reason.

Well that's one way to see it, as for me throttling the CPU is the last
resort before seeing it die ; I find it sad to waste all the performance
of a 3288 that way, otherwise it's easier to use something like a dirt
a much slower and cheaper cortex A5. But I agree with the point regarding
the gpio-pwm. I think that mqmaker initially designed the GPIO to be used
as a led to benefit from the heartbeat trigger which more or less replaces
what a more efficient thermal control could achieve.

Thanks!
Willy
