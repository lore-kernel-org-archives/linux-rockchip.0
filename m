I guess I just misunderstood "it's out of the question that changes to
the API will be required".  In any case, I think everyone's on the
same page here, so no need to debate further.  :)

Ah, right!  I forgot that the existing API will be updated if you've
reconfigured the period via pwm_config().  Ugh, you're right that's a
little ugly then.

So do we define it as:

pwm_get_state(): always get the hardware state w/ no caching (maybe
even pwm_get_raw_state() or pwm_get_hw_state())

pwm_get_period(): get the period of the PWM; if the PWM has not yet
been configured by software this gets the default period (possibly
specified by the device tree).


Is that OK?  That is well defined and doesn't change the existing
behavior of pwm_get_period().

I guess it depends on how you define things.  With my above
definitions it seems clearest if pwm_get_state() returns an error if
hardware readout is not supported.  If we call it pwm_get_hw_state()
it's even clearer that it should return an error.

Right, so we can't do that.

That should work with one minor problem.  If HW readout isn't
supported then pwm_get_state() in probe will presumably return 0 for
the duty cycle.  That means it will change the voltage.  That's in
contrast to how I think things work today where the voltage isn't
changed until the first set_voltage() call.  At least the last time I
tested things get_voltage() would simply report an incorrect value
until the first set_voltage().  I think existing behavior (reporting
the wrong value) is better than new behavior (change the value at
probe).

I'm curious, though.  In your proposal, how does pwm_get_period()
behave?  To be backward compatible, I'd imagine that even in your
proposal we'd have the same definition as I had above:

pwm_get_period(): get the period of the PWM; if the PWM has not yet
been configured by software this gets the default period (possibly
specified by the device tree).


If you have a different definition of pwm_get_period() in your
proposal, please let me know!  If my definition matches your thoughts
then I think we can actually just not touch the "set_voltage" call.
It can always use pwm_get_period() and always use pwm_config() just
like today.

...and if set_voltage() remains untouched then we can solve my probe
problem by renaming pwm_get_state() to pwm_get_hw_state() and having
it return an error if HW readout is not supported.  Then we only call
pwm_get_args() / pwm_apply_state() when we support HW readout.


Thus, if HW readout:

* In probe, we read HW state (pwm_get_hw_state) and atomically adjust
(pwm_apply_state) based on arguments (pwm_get_args).

* In set_voltage we use pwm_get_period which will return the period we
applied in pwm_apply_state() and use pwm_config() to change the duty
cycle.


If no HW readout, no behavior change at all from today:

* In probe we don't do anything to change the PWM

* Upon the first set_voltage we use pwm_get_period() to get the period
as specified in DT and use pwm_config() to change the duty cycle.


That seems pretty sane to me.  What do you think?
