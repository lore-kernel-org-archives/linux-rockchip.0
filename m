I see that's what you're doing in a patch later in this series. Good.

I was revisiting the logic here though, and I don't understand your
error case. You're treating "too low" and "too high" the same, and in
either case, you're choosing a value of ->data_mask. That doesn't make
sense to me, especially for ADC_DECREMENT cases like rk3288. In that
case, you're programming the trip to the lowest possible temperature.

It seems like either you should make this conditional, so that "too low"
and "too high" make sane alternative choices (like MAX or MIN temp), or
else restructure this to pass error codes back to the upper layers.
