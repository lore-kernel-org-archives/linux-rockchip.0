Thanks for your reply, the patchs look better than mine.
I have tested them on sdk board and i found something may be wrong.
"parent->of_node" instead of "parent", as the parent is not null if=20
parent-node not used.
         if (parent->of_node) {
             iod->grf =3D syscon_node_to_regmap(parent->of_node);
         } else {
             dev_dbg(&pdev->dev, "falling back to old binding\n");
             iod->grf =3D syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle(np, "rockchip=
,grf");
         }
