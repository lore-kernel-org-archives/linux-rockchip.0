GPUs on embedded devices are mem-to-mem, and they're definitely shared =

If we decide that 2D blitters should be supported by V4L2 (and I'm open=
 to get=20
convinced about that), we really need to define a proper API before mer=
ging a=20
bunch of drivers that will implement things in slightly different ways,=
=20
otherwise the future will be very painful.

Among the issues that need to be solved are

- stateful vs. stateless operation (as mentioned by Jacob in this mail=20=

thread), a.k.a. the request API

- exposing capabilities to userspace (a single capability flag would be=
 enough=20
only if all blitters expose the same API, which I'm not sure we can ass=
ume)

- single input (a.k.a. in-place blitters as you mentioned below) vs. mu=
ltiple=20
inputs

- API for 2D-accelerated operations other than blitting (filling, point=
 and=20
line drawing, ...)
