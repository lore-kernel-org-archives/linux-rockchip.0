git history. get_maintainers.pl had too many cases where I ended up as
the maintainer.

I'll drop him.

Sorry, I thought I addressed these previous comments.

Sure, you can do this if you like. I prefer the other way as it is a
one line change to add a board. The SoC maintainers can pick whatever
they like. You could split into a file per SoC too if you wanted.

Generally when we had just 'hello,foobar' with 'Hello Foobar' I
dropped the comment as I didn't think it added much.
