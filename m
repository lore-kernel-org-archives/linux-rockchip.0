It wasn't meant as a requirement, more like a thought I had and wanted =
to=20
discuss ;-) . So far I also only saw talks about devicetree overlays bu=
t=20
never in action yet.

I would have hoped there to be some gpio indicating if it's connected t=
o the=20
"LandingShip" but that doesn't seem to be the case after looking throug=
h the=20
schematics again.

In any case, going the regular way should be ok as well.

maybe also rk3368-geekbox-som.dtsi like the rk3288-rock2-som.dtsi. That=
 way=20
it would show clearly its status as system on module which then gets us=
ed=20
somewhere.

And as said above, the compatible should probably live in the dts, not =
the=20
dtsi (see rock2).

I'm fine with going the always-on/boot-on way at first. Sorting which=20
regulators can actually be disabled can also be done later - especially=
 as=20
some components still don't do regulator-handling.

Because the r88 board doesn't actually have a pmic ;-) . Just a bunch o=
f=20
individual (and mostly always-on) regulators on the board - thankfully =
I=20
have schematics for it.

I'd hope so.
