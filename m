I'm still pondering this. I.e. I'm not sure I really like adding all these
empty nodes only to have them filled in board devicetrees.

This is specific to the audio-graph-card, and neither simple-audio-card
nor the Rockchip-specific cards we have use something like this, so
currently I'm tending to just have all audio-graph-nodes defined in the
board devicetree using it.

For example similar to arch/arm64/boot/dts/hisilicon/hi6220-hikey.dts
or zte/zx296718-pcbox.dts do it.

It would be different if the graph-links were actually on the soc-level
like vop<->hdmi or so, but this is completely board-specific.

Same for the others below.

Thoughts?
Heiko
