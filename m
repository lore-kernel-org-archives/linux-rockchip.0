I have known this function,
rk_crypto_action will be executed next to either failed _probe, or
_remove automatically.
It also make sure reset_control_assert can be executed after tasklet_ki=
ll.

OK! Done!

I guess I can remove it if I added code you provided above since
reset-assert will be
executed after _remove by rk_crypto_action.

Right.
