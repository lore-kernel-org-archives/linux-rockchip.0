I meant to say that the clock sources are different in each SoC,
but yes the same clock input is always needed by the GPU.

The TRM is confidential but to the best of my knowledge and based
on existing device trees and the out-of-tree kernel driver, the
Midgard GPU has only one clock input.

OK, so I'll make the vendor compatible strings required (for
Midgard) in patch v5.
