I guess the underlying problem there is that there are at least 3 
different significant aspects to what "synchronous" can mean:

- literally in the context or device/driver registration as documented. 
Off-hand I'm not really sure what useful property may be *specific* to 
those conditions that a driver might rely on, other than for 
super-special cases like platform_driver_probe().

- serialised, i.e. probes of multiple devices won't happen concurrently 
on multiple threads. This is probably the one hiding the most driver 
bugs, e.g. internal shared/global state without sufficient 
synchronisation. I guess this falls out as a side-effect of the first 
condition, but AFAICS it *can* also still provided by deferred probe 
(given that it's a single work item iterating a list one-by-one)

- in some regular thread context that isn't liable to have issues 
synchronising against other async_func workers (i.e. the request_module 
case). Again, deferred can't have a problem here, or it wouldn't have 
worked properly in general for the last decade.

So it's not that we'd be relying on some dubious "deferred is always 
synchronous" assumption - AFAICS deferred *can* launch async if the 
driver permits it - more just ratifying that deferred is still able to 
effectively honour all the useful properties of PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS 
other than "during registration of the thing". And where people do want 
the semantics for a platform_driver_probe()-like thing, then I think 
it's reasonable to say that they should definitely never be invoking 
that from the probe routine of some other driver which permits async itself.

Thanks,
Robin.
