Sure, it's right.
I think that main reason of HLE is wait_prvdata_complete. (I'm guessing..)
On other hands, dwmmc controller is handling something wrong. (I found that HLE is occurred the similar case.)
After find the main solution, it's not bad that your patch is applied on dwmmc controller.

Ulf have sent PR for next..So if we needs to apply this, i will apply on fix.
