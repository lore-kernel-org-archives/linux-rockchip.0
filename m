looks like I forgot to finish my thought "... the vpll as regular dclk_vop 
source".

I guess that is mainly me being overly careful and not overlooking if the 
clock-framework can get into any troubled state if all clocks do this, but I 
guess it should just work ;-) .

I think the big issue on the rk3288 is, who is actually in charge of 
controlling the npll frequency.

On the rk3399 the vpll is supplied unmodified to the hdmiphy, while as a 
dclk_vop source it goes through a divider first. So it's pretty clear that the 
hdmiphy will control the core frequency while other users need to adapt to 
what they get.

On the rk3288 the npll is a possible source to both the hdmi- as well as the 
edp-clock (and some others as well), so when it gets adapted dynamically, wo 
is going to be in charge and who needs to adapt ... and how do we set this 
hierarchy.
