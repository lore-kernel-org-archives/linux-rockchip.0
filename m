I have a question for this patch-set. Does DWMMC IP support to invert ON/OFF at Power Enable register?
Hmm..Well, if use the DW_MMC_CARD_PWR_INVERT, it should also be the similar behavior with Quirks.

Other flags are related with dwmmc IP. But this flag (DW_MMC_CARD_PWR_INVERT) is not related with IP side.
I understood why you needs to add this flag..Is rockchip designed to invert the power controlling?

But it's not general case. We can discuss about this.

Best Regards,
Jaehoon Chung
