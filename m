Yes, thanks :)

FWIW:

Tested-by: Brian Norris <briannorris@chromium.org>

Also, for some reason the eMMC crashes are now harder to reproduce.
Perhaps I was just (un)lucky the first few times I tested. Maybe it's an
existing issue and hasn't gotten much worse, except for possibly the
additional churn that runtime PM gives it.

But the SDIO/Wifi issues were definitely the primary thing that prompted
my original report, so I'm much happier now.
