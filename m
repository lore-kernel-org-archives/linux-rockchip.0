This is a standard micro SD card socket that can also be used for
booting the board. I wanted to be cautious and start
working with it and several SD cards and explore the capabilities.

On this board nearly all regulators are still continously
switched on. I plan to remove the always-on properties step
by step from the regulators when the board runs stable with it's
components all enbled.

It's not embedded, just a standard µSD plug. It is already enabled
by mainline U-Boot and ejecting and inserting the card works fine.
