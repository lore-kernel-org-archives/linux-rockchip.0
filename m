Okay.

I think this line was already there, I missed to correct it, Will update in=
 v3.

Yes, this is correct. So far there was only one vendor using '#clock-cells'=
  which is Rockchip. I have sent DT patch (02/11) for that also.
Here this is needed as earlier implementation isn't correct as suggested by=
 Uffe. (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/20/486) .

Thanks,
Manish
