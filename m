Hmm, in fact, isn't the deferred probe mechanism itself actually quite
appropriate? A suitable calling context isn't the most obvious "resource
provider" to wait for, but ultimately it's still a case of "we don't
have everything we need right now, but it's worth trying again soon".
I may have missed some subtleties, but my instinct is that it could
perhaps be as simple as something like this (completely untested).

Cheers,
Robin.
