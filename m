Hi Mark,

You can have several timers on the system and may want to use the clockevents
from one IP block and the clocksource from another IP block. For example, in
the case of a bogus clocksource.

Moreover there are some drivers with a node for a clocksource and
another one for the clockevent, and the driver is assuming the clockevent is
defined first and then the clocksource.

eg.

arch/arc/boot/dts/abilis_tb10x.dtsi:

        /* TIMER0 with interrupt for clockevent */
        timer0 {
                compatible = "snps,arc-timer";
                interrupts = <3>;
                interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
                clocks = <&cpu_clk>;
        };

        /* TIMER1 for free running clocksource */
        timer1 {
                compatible = "snps,arc-timer";
                clocks = <&cpu_clk>;
        };

drivers/clocksource/arc_timer.c:

static int __init arc_of_timer_init(struct device_node *np)
{
        static int init_count = 0;
        int ret;

        if (!init_count) {
                init_count = 1;
                ret = arc_clockevent_setup(np);
        } else {
                ret = arc_cs_setup_timer1(np);
        }

        return ret;
}

Even if that works, it is a fragile mechanism.

So the purpose of these changes is to provide a stronger timer declaration in
order to clearly split in the kernel a clocksource and a clockevent
initialization.

So if this is hackish DT changes, then the existing DTs should be fixed, no?

That was the idea. Create a macro CLOCKEVENT_OF and CLOCKSOURCE_OF both of them
calling their respective init routines. And in addition a TIMER_OF doing both
CLOCKEVENT_OF and CLOCKSOURCE_OF.

It is the DT which does not allow to do this separation.

Would be the following approach more acceptable ?

1. Replace all CLOCKSOURCE_OF by TIMER_OF (just renaming)
2. A node can have a clockevent and|or a clocksource attributes
3. The timer_probe pass a flag to the driver's init function, so this one knows
   if it should invoke the clockevent/clocksource init functions.
   No attribute defaults to clocksource|clockevent.

That would be backward compatible and will let to create drivers with clutch
activated device via DT. Also, it will give the opportunity to the existing
drivers to change consolidate their initialization routines.
