Alright. I guess breaking DTBs for Rockchip platforms isn't
acceptable, especially if those are already widely deployed, which I
have no idea of....

And having support for both options in the driver seems not a great
option either, so it looks like you need to convert back into the old
v1 approach. Huh, sorry.

Uffe
