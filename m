I've just tested this series and the internal screen works with this
too. Screenblank still seems to freeze the kernel though. Eg.
# setterm --powersave on
# setterm --blank 1
#  < wait 1 minute >

But getting output on the screen is progress ;)

As for the spi change suspend now works too, which it didn't before,
but the screen just didn't come up properly after the suspend. I could
still ssh into it after suspend though.
