Looks like next is missing the DRM side of the series, which makes the
driver in question not need this header anymore.

This is probably because we missed this hidden dependency and decided
to push the IOMMU part separately through the IOMMU tree. I guess we
can remove the offending patch from the IOMMU tree and let the DRM
tree include it based on a topic branch from Joerg.

Joerg, David, Mark Yao, what do you think?

Best regards,
Tomasz
