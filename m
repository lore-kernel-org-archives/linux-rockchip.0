I agree that this sounds like a pretty big change in behavior, yes. I am
somewhat suspicious of any silent mainline difference from silicon defaults
as being the result of cargo-culting from downstream hacks to make things
work, and are unresolved technical debt in need of cleanup.

On the RK3576 board I'm currently working on, where an RK806 is used as
well, then DCDC8 cutting out would wreak havoc on warm reboots I'd wager
as it's used for a lot of 1.8V IO voltage supply things, including one
instance where the DCDC8 rail going low would feed into a downstream
regulator that's being kept enabled as long as a different supply is on.

If you don't want to deal with DT bindings people (sysfs for reset
behaviour? What?) a workaround for this could be to add the necessary
register write to your bootloader's (probably u-boot?) board init code.

I do think however that "what does this board hardware expect to happen to
power rails on reset" is a pretty strongly board specific non-enumerable
hardware difference that belongs in DT as a declarative property, but
perhaps in a different form than the bare register contents for this, so
that it can hopefully be used as a more generic (even if vendor) property
for future PMICs going forward. Think regulator-always-on but for this
specific case.
