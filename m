Ah, so that is what you are concerned about: future misuses. Well, I
don't really see the problem. There are only ~18 calls to
vm_insert_page() in the entire kernel: checking if people is using it
properly for a while should be easy. As long as the new behavior is
documented properly, it should be fine. If you are really concerned
about mistakes being made, then fine, we can rename it as I suggested.

Now, the new vm_insert_range() is another topic. It simplifies a few
of the callers and buys us the rename at the same time, so I am also
OK with it.

As you see, I am not against the changes -- it is just that they
should clearly justified. :-) It wasn't clear what your problem with
the current vm_insert_page() is.

Cheers,
Miguel
