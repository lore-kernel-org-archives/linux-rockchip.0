Thanks a lot for your suggestion.
I agree with you.  clk_enable() will call spin_lock_irqsave() to disable 
interrupt, and we add
more than 1ms in clk_enable may cause big latency.

And according to clk_prepare() description:
  In a simple case, clk_prepare can be used instead of clk_enable to 
ungate a clk if the
  operation may sleep.  One example is a clk which is accessed over I2c.

So maybe we can remove the clock to clk_prepare.

Hi Heiko, Frank,
        What  do you think of it?
