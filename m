I had read that already. I figured that was just rationale for not
documenting the feature (still silly IMO), and not for avoiding using
the existing feature.

What is this "label" feature Rob speaks of? Does it exist in practice
(AFAICT the answer is "no")? The description doesn't seem terrible,
depending on the implementation. Would that become the actual device
name (i.e., dev_name(dev))? Or just a filesystem symlink? And how does
one assign such a label?
