Hi Jaehoon,

Thanks for checking that. I didn't notice this part of code either unti=
l
I began to develop f2fs last month.
yes, I can't find any reasons not to enable it for dw_mmc because I loo=
k
more into dwmmc-databooks to see if any version of IP can't support
ERASE/TRIM command, and find none of them. So, enabling it by default i=
s
safe.
