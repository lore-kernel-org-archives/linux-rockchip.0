...but once you say that it's HID over I2C then it becomes probe-able,
right?  Said another way: we need to specify just enough to power the
device up properly and then we can ask it what kind of device it is
and then we can make quirk decisions based on that.

So specifying what kind of device it is in the device tree is somewhat
redundant and it also means that you make it needlessly difficult to
build a system with dual-sourced components.

One of the major points of probe-able connections is that you could
put anything you want there and the kernel _doesn't_ need to describe
it.  ...and the whole point of device tree (I thought) was to
specifically handle connections that _aren't_ probe-able.

For instance, if a board has a USB bus on it but you need to assert a
special reset or turn on a special regulator (besides vbus) before you
can probe the USB bus, you wouldn't think that the board should
specify exactly what device was stuffed in the connection, would you?

Isn't it a little of each, though?  When you say that there's a USB
port or an SDIO port or a serial port on the board, you're saying more
than just that there are 2, 4, or 8 wires coming out of the board.
You're saying that you're expecting to talk a certain protocol over
those wires.
