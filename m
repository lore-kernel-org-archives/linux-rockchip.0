Or just always check for the presence of the property and just make the
driver warn if that bvalid_session setting is not available for that soc yet.

From the TRMs I have your rk3399 bvalid_session settings seems to live
in the depths of the undocumented inno-phy regs, so that will probably
be the same for other socs using that phy.
