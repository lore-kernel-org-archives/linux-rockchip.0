Yes, but this is the job of device drivers which are runtime PM adapted
to gate their own clocks.  I agree these clocks need to be enumerated in
the DTS, but they should be in the device nodes.

Yes, this is pretty common for reset.

I don't follow this sentence.  Are you saying doing that will not solve
the above issues?  Why not?  Please explain.

If there are non-device clocks that also need to be enabled before
asserting reset, then those are candidates for the power-domain node,
but not device clocks.

I don't think this is an SoC design issue as this is needed when you
have synchronous reset.  My concern is primarily around how to describe
this in the DT.
