Sigh, yes, if there are a bunch of functions needing subnodes like the
above, then yes that makes sense. But that's not what has been
presented. Please make some attempt at defining *all* the functions.
An actual binding would be nice, but I'll settle for just a list of
things. The list should have functions that have DT dependencies (like
clocks for phys in the above) because until you do, you don't need
child nodes.

Is there really just one GPIO? If it has a defined function, then is
it really GP? Can you control direction? I know Linus W doesn't like
that kind of abuse of GPIO.
