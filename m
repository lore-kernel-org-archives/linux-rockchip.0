The file mmc.txt says on top:
"These properties are common to multiple MMC host controllers".
As my patchset introduces "disable-cqe-dcmd" just for sdhci-of-arasan,
I would say it should not go into that file.

Also I wonder why "supports-cqe" is in mmc.txt, because
only sdhci-tegra.c is evaluating that property.
So I would expect it to be documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/nvidia,tegra20-sdhci.txt

However, I see that "disable-cqe-dcmd" could go into other drivers as well.
But is this enough to document it in mmc.txt?
