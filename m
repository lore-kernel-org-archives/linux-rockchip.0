vqmmc-supply is the so called io-voltage according to the code and also the 
jedec spec (VCCQ). And the sdmmc0_vdd that vccio_sd is connected to is exactly 
that ... according to the rk3288 datasheet the "SDMMC0 Digital IO Power 
Supply", so that connection is not only meaningful for the iodomains, but _is_ 
an actual supply and if you turn off vccio_sd, you probably won't get any 
sdmmc transfers at all ;-) .

So yes, due to the resistor misheap vccio_sd should stay limited to 3.3V, but 
its connection as vqmmc should stay.
