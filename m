But surely one can scan thru it and have some clue what functions
there are. For example, does this chip have phy registers in GRF?

Yes, and in that case it makes sense. The individual functions
themselves have resources defined in DT like clocks. What I don't want
to see are child nodes defining *only* a compatible and any provider
properties (e.g. #gpio-cells). The only reason to do that is to make
Linux bind a driver, but DT is not a list of drivers to bind.

This is what I don't want to see:

syscon {
  compatible =3D "foo,soc-sysctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
  reg =3D <...>;
  clock-controller {
    compatible =3D "foo,soc-sysctrl-clocks";
    #clock-cells =3D <1>;
  };
  reset-controller {
    compatible =3D "foo,soc-sysctrl-resets";
    #reset-cells =3D <1>;
  };
  gpio {
    compatible =3D "foo,soc-sysctrl-gpios";
    #gpio-cells =3D <2>;
    gpio-controller;
  };
};

But rather:

syscon {
  compatible =3D "foo,soc-sysctrl";
  reg =3D <...>;
  #clock-cells =3D <1>;
  #reset-cells =3D <1>;
  #gpio-cells =3D <2>;
  gpio-controller;
};

I can tell that from your examples, but I can't tell that with this
binding. For this binding, it looks like you are adding a sub-node for
1 register bit. That wouldn't scale if you have 11 page register list.

Okay, but still my question remains: is it really only 1 GPIO?
Dropping "-mute" would be more future proof if not.
