nit: I would have expected ${SUBJECT} to have v2 in it somewhere.

Aww crud.  I was at the airport yesterday and so I didn't notice that
you were touching rk3399, not rk3399-gru.  This belongs in the gru
device tree file, not in the top level rk3399.  As you have written
this it will break rk3399 boards that have an rk808 on them, AKA:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-ficus.dts:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-firefly.dts:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-puma.dtsi:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-sapphire.dtsi:
