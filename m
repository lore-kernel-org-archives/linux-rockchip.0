That rockchip-efuse.c driver shouldn't be work.

An entire 8-bit word of data can be read in one read operation with=20
STROBE being high and a proper address
selected (address signals A5~A7 are =E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t cares=E2=80=9D=
).

That's great if we can get the content from the .reg_read when the=20
consumer driver
callback the nvmem_cell_read().

e.g.:
static struct regmap_config rockchip_efuse_regmap_config =3D {
     .reg_bits =3D 32,
     .val_bits =3D 8,
     .reg_stride =3D 1,
     .reg_read =3D rockchip_efuse_reg_read,
};
=2E..
/ * consumer driver */
nvmem_cell_get()/nvmem_cell_put();
nvmem_cell_read()/nvmem_cell_write();
=2E.......
