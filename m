I hadn't got my head round only one table being in use at a time for 
this frame based API, nor had I appreciated that all the DQT 
parsing/creation etc was handled in userspace.

So, yeah, I agree that this JPEG control only needs a single luma and 
chroma pair of tables for this usage scenario.

Thanks for the explanation.
