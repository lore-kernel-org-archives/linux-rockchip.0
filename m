Thanks for your advice.

As outsider it's a little bit difficult to comment on that.
Maybe an insider can give a better answer.
The rk3066 is there early model.
Reusing blocks like in the later improved models wasn't in the fashion
yet I think.
Also comparing the rk3066-hdmi driver to the inno driver gives too many
differences in registers, sound support and irqs.
If it was similar they would have combined it in there own kernel.
Given the age there won't come any other support for it.
This is what we have...

Will change that in V2.
rk3066-hdmi      -> rk3066-hdmi-rockchip.txt

How about the other documents?
rk3036-inno-hdmi -> inno_hdmi-rockchip.txt
rk3288-dw-hdmi   -> dw_hdmi-rockchip.txt
rk3288-dp        -> analogix_dp-rockchip.txt
etc.

Should "ports" be replaced by: "hdmi_in: port"?
What is preferred?

There are two different methods in use:
-1
		hdmi_in: port {

-2
		ports {
			hdmi_in: port {

Which hdmi-connector node?
Could you explane with an example?
The Rockchip hdmi nodes I'm aware off only use the port nodes as a way
to switch the hdmi input between the vop's.
The vop nodes can have multiple outputs.

Will change that in V2.
