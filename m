    Others, we can verify this driver for the EDP.
    We can apply the following these patchs.

    There is a recent addition from Linus Walleij,
    called simple-mfd [a] that is supposed to get added real early for kernel 4.2

Changes in v16:
- remove the pmu node.
- Add more domain decription.
- the driver type from tristate to bool.
- Letter misspelled.
- As Ulf suggestion, remove #include <linux/clk-provider.h>,
  use "%pC" as the formatting string for the dev_dbg().
- As the Ulf suggestion, set the genpd->flags to assign the
  ->stop|start() callbacks.
- Manually copy the problem in patch v15.
- rebase the description.

Changes in v15:
- change the comment.
- As the kevin suggestion, put the power-domain driver into driver/soc/vendor.
- As Heiko suggestion, Patch 1: binding doc, 2: binding-header, 3: driver,
  4: dts-changes.
- return -ENXIO --> return -ENODEV.
- As Tomasz remarked previously the dts should represent the hardware
  and the power-domains are part of the pmu.

Changes in v14:
- does not need to set an owner,remove the "THIS_MODULE".
- Remove essential clocks from rk3288 PD_VIO domain, Some clocks are
  essential for the system health and should not be turned down.
  However there is no owner for them so if they listed as belonging to power
  domain we'll try toggling them up and down during power domain transition.
  As a result we either fail to suspend or resume the system.

Changes in v13:
- Remove essential clocks from rk3288 PD_VIO domain Some clocks are essential
  for the system health and should not be turned down. However there is no owner
  for them so if they listed as belonging to power domain we'll try toggling them
  up and down during power domain.
- Device drivers expect their devices to be powered on before their
  probing code is invoked. To achieve that we should start with
  power domains powered on (we may turn them off later once all devices enable
  runtime powermanagment and go idle).
- This change switches Rockchip power domain driver to use updated
  device_attach and device_detach API.
- set the gpu/core power domain power delay time.
- fix enumerating PM clocks for devices.
- fix use after free We can't use clk after we did clk_put(clk).

Changes in v12:
- fix the title doamin->domain.
- updated device_attach and device_detach API,otherwise it will
  compile fail on next kernel.

Changes in v11:
- fix pm_genpd_init(&pd->genpd, NULL, false).

Changes in v10:
- this switches over domain infos to use masks instead of recomputing
  them each time and also gets rid of custom domain translator and
  uses standard onecell on.
- fix missing the #include <dt-bindings/power-domain/rk3288.h>.
- remove the notes.

Changes in v9:
- add document decription.
- fix v8 changes as follows:
- This reconciles the v2 and v7 code so that we power domain have lists of clocks
  they trigger on and off during power transitions and independently from power
  domains clocks. We attach clocks to devices comprising power domain and prepare
  them so they are turn on and off by runtime PM.
- add rockchip_pm_add_one_domain() to control domains.
- add pd_start/pd_stop interface to control clocks.
- add decription for power-doamin node.

Changes in v8:
- document go back to v2.
- This reconciles the v2 and v7 code so that we power domain have
  lists of clocks they toggle on and off during power transitions
  and independently from power domains clocks we attach clocks to
  devices comprising power domain and prepare them so they are
  turn on and off by runtime PM.
- DTS go back to v2.

Changes in v7:
 - Delete unused variables

Changes in v6:
- delete pmu_lock.
- modify dev_lock using mutex.
- pm_clk_resume(pd->dev) change to pm_clk_resume(ed->dev).
- pm_clk_suspend(pd->dev) change to pm_clk_suspend(ed->dev).
- add devm_kfree(pd->dev, de) in rockchip_pm_domain_detach_dev.

Changes in v5:
- delete idle_lock.
- add timeout in rockchip_pmu_set_idle_request().

Changes in v4:
- use list storage dev.

Changes in v3:
- DT structure has changed.
- change use pm_clk_resume() and pm_clk_suspend().
- Decomposition power-controller, changed to multiple controller
  (gpu-power-controller, hevc-power-controller).

Changes in v2:
- move clocks to "optional".
- remove the "pd->pd.of_node = np".
- make pd_vio clocks all one entry per line and alphabetize.
- power: power-controller move back to pinctrl: pinctrl.
