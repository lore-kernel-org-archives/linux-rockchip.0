As I understand it (AKA please correct me if I'm wrong)...

Usually CLK_IS_CRITICAL is more suitable than CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED since
lots of old code used CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED for critical clocks before
CLK_IS_CRITICAL existed.

...but in this case, I don't think it is more suitable.
CLK_IS_CRITICAL means that the kernel should be in charge of keeping
this clock on at all times.  The documentation I see says:

#define CLK_IS_CRITICAL         BIT(11) /* do not gate, ever */

In our case, as was so eloquently described in our private bug by our
firmware engineer:

  Just tell the kernel to keep its grubby hands off my clocks completely

AKA: this isn't a clock that the kernel should touch--it is entirely
managed by the firmware.  It's OK for the kernel to show it in the
clock tree, but otherwise "hands off".
