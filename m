Thanks for your explanation.  I see, it's really about special
things that are not supported by the standard Midgard kernel
driver.

I see the "platform" directory approach as an old and deprecated
way of supporting platforms, upstreaming the dt bindings goes in
the direction of using solely the device tree to describe the GPU
hardware (i.e. CONFIG_MALI_PLATFORM_DEVICETREE).  If something
quirky is needed in the platform, it should be possible to
support it outside the GPU driver (platform devfreq etc...).

Back to the original intent of enabling distros to make Mali GPU
driver packages, when using the device tree you can have a single
kernel driver package for all Midgard platforms.  When using the
third-party platform sources approach, you need to make an extra
package for each one of them.

So if there is value in supporting platforms that absolutely
require something special due to their hardware GPU integration,
then yes I see why vendor dt bindings might be useful.  However
it seems to me that this should really be an exception and
avoided whenever possible.

For the rk3288, this is purely a software implementation issue on
the chromeos-3.14 branch.  With mainline kernel, you can use
devfreq and no platform files at all (that's how I tested these
dt bindings).  So as far as I know, there's no need for a vendor
compatible string on rk3288.

I'm not too familiar with that driver, just had a quick look and
it seems to be a different issue as there's a kernel config for
each platform to build separate driver modules.  And it looks
like they are actually needed to cope with variants of the
hardware inside the display processor block, unlike with the Mali
GPU which in principle should always be the same.  I've run this
Midgard driver without any platform files and using devfreq at
least on rk3288 Firefly, Exynos 5422 ODROID-XU3 and Juno and they
all have a vanilla Mali GPU hw block.  It's just wired
differently in each SoC.

How about aiming for the ideal case where vendor-specific things
are not needed and add them if and when they really become
inevitable and worth the cost?

Thanks,
Guillaume
