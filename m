Hi Mark, Dylan,
I tried to use simple-card and had some trouble that jack detection. So=
=20
my idea is simply:
                                                   /-- rockchip_max9809=
0=20
(to configure max98090, and no need to via DTS)
    rockchip_machine_driver  |-- rockchip_rt5645 (to configure=20
rt5650/rt5645, and no need to via DTS)
(supported codecs via DTS)   \-- rockchip_(maybe other codecs)

It is right that it is base on original rockchip_max98090, but the old=20
rockchip_max98090 used DTS.

I tried to explain my ideas. Your kind suggestions will be highly=20
appreciated.

Thanks.
