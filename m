Does it associate any of the registers with the HDMI PHY? According to
the register definitions in drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/dw_hdmi.h the PHY
registers are interleaved with other registers that are likely part of
the HDMI transmitter proper (there are things like HDCP and CEC engines
in that IP as well).

That's just from skimming drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/dw_hdmi.h (register
offsets 0x3000 and the following). The large gap between them and the
preceding FC registers could be an additional indication that they are
indeed separate IP blocks. Then again, the AUD registers start at an
offset of 0x3100, so maybe it's no indication at all.

Are these the registers used to control the PHY that you're referring
to? It seems odd to me that the documentation would specify these
registers interleaved with other registers if the PHYs can be freely
chosen from a set of HDMI PHYs. Perhaps the set of PHYs that can be used
need to expose the same integration interface? Maybe these registers
aren't used to control the PHY at all but rather configure the interface
between transmitter and PHY?

Sorry if these are more questions that the documentation doesn't answer.
Just trying to understand what's going on.

HEAC could be "HDMI Ethernet Audio Control", see here:

Yes, that's what I was implying.

Yes, I agree. One problem that you could run into with such a split is
that the PHY control registers may be interleaved with the registers of
the HDMI transmitter. But perhaps my understanding is wrong and the PHY
is truly controlled via a completely own set of registers. Looking at
the implementation, the HDMI_PHY_* registers seem to be used to control
various aspects of an interface between transmitter and PHY rather than
the PHY itself and it seems like the PHY itself is really an I2C slave
accessed using the I2C master controlled using the HDMI_PHY_I2CM_*
registers.

So perhaps the HDMI transmitter DT node really should expose the PHY as
an I2C child. In fact, looking at HDMI_PHY_I2CM_SLAVE_ADDR_* field
values (lines 870 and 871 in dw_hdmi.h) it should have two children, one
for the "GEN2" PHY and one for the "HEAC" PHY. You could even go as far
as exposing the HDMI_PHY_I2CM_* registers as I2C master and implement
the PHYs as proper I2C client drivers, but that might be overkill,
especially considering that you'd need to have extra API to convey the
HDMI configuration. Still, might be worth considering to make the split
really explicit.

I guess I've answered most of my earlier questions myself...

That's really one more reason to write proper drivers for the PHYs. If
you really ever have to deal with a different PHY chances are that more
than just the supplies will be different, in which case you'd need to
somehow also abstract away the interoperation between HDMI transmitter
and PHY.

I feel the same way. Although there have been occasional exceptions to
the DT ABI stability rule if it could be proven that an existing binding
was completely wrong, I've made the experience that putting as little as
possible into DT (and at the same time resist the temptation of a
generic solution) helps keep the headaches in check.

Fortunately the dw-hdmi driver gets much of this right already (it's
helper code rather than a proper driver), so keeping things like power
supplies specific to a particular integration should be easy to do and
prevent potential future incompatibilities.
