pwm_round_state() is fundamentally racy. What if, for example, you have
two consumers racing to set two PWMs provided by the same controller. If
you have some dependency between the two PWMs (perhaps they need to
share the same divider or something like that), then between the time
where pwm_round_state() returns and pwm_apply_state() is called, the
results of the pwm_round_state() may no longer be valid.

Well, that's what you have to do anyway. I mean, you can't write one
voltage table that works for one device and then expect it to work for
every other device. DT by definition is a board-level definition.

Hm... indeed. Requiring the duty-cycle to be in percent is not a good
idea. That's going to lead to rounding one way or another.

I agree that an algorithm is usually better, but if you can't create an
algorithm that works, it's usually better to have a hand-coded fallback
rather than have no working system at all.

I didn't say it was impossible. I said it can't be guaranteed. There may
very well be combinations of drivers and consumers where the results
will be accurate, but there may very well be other combinations where
the results won't be. So if you don't know the exact combination, you
can't be sure that the result will be accurate.

Now it seems like both voltage table and continuous modes seem to rely
on some relative duty cycle setting, in which case there's typically
going to be rounding in both cases (unless you make the duty cycle range
large enough to accomodate the whole range from 0 to period.
