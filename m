To me these names are non-obvious and I would rather expect choosing
meaningful names when putting something into the mainline. The user
(Android) will use this mainline kernel release in a year or more (3
years for vendors?), so it will have plenty of time to adopt. :)

But this was already discussed and you got ack from Rob, so let's move
on. I don't mind.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
