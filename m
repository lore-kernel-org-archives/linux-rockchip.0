Well, my patch was just an informal proposal, and Doug pointed one
thing that needs to be addressed before considering this approach: we
are breaking clk users that expect clk_disable/unprepare() to be
synchronous even when they're called before clk_disable_unused().

Mike, Stephen, any idea how to solve this problem properly?
