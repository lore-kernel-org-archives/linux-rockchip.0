Pulled into clk-next.

BUT, this has some checkpatch annoyances, mostly spaces before
tabs in the DT headers. For example:

WARNING: please, no space before tabs
#162: FILE: include/dt-bindings/clock/rk3399-cru.h:139:
+#define FCLK_CM0S ^I^I^I190$

WARNING: please, no space before tabs
#233: FILE: include/dt-bindings/clock/rk3399-cru.h:210:
+#define ACLK_PERF_CORE_L ^I^I260$

Please send another patch to fix those or do it in another pull,
whatever works for you.
