I called it out in v1 [1] since this bit is new since v4.4 where I
originally wrote this patch, and didn't get any comments about it.

I've convinced myself that removing the lock doesn't cause any problems
for writing to the hardware: if the lock would prevent writes
interleaving then it means that two callers are trying to write
different drive strengths to the same pin, and even with a lock here one
of them will end up with the wrong drive strength.

But it does mean that a read via rockchip_get_drive_perpin() may see an
inconsistent state.  I think adding a new lock specifically for this
particular drive strength bit is overkill and I can't find a scenario
where this will actually matter; any driver setting a pinctrl config
must already be doing something to avoid racing two configurations
against each other, mustn't it?
