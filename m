that should be related to the many trips. The trips will search the next 
trips.
So in general, trip_ponit_0_temp <= trip_ponit_1_temp <=trip_ponit_1_temp.

I'm assume you set"echo 700000 > trip_point_0_temp", and you keep trip1 
and trip2....

  [   34.449718] trip_point_temp_store, temp=700000

===>　So rockchip thermal will return 0.


That should report error when you meet the needs of order.
order--> trip_ponit_0_temp <= trip_ponit_1_temp <=trip_ponit_1_temp.

Fox example:
[  100.898552] thermal_sys: thermal_zone_set_trips:583, temp=58333, 
trip_temp=700000, hys=2000
[  100.906964] thermal_sys: thermal_zone_set_trips:583, temp=58333, 
trip_temp=710000, hys=2000
[  100.916329] thermal_sys: thermal_zone_set_trips:583, temp=58333, 
trip_temp=720000, hys=2000
[  100.924685] thermal thermal_zone0: new temperature boundaries: 
-2147483647 < x < 700000
[  100.932965] rockchip-thermal ff260000.tsadc: 
rockchip_thermal_set_trips: sensor 0: low: -2147483647, high 700000
[  100.943138] rk_tsadcv2_alarm_temp:682, temp=700000
[  100.948201] rk_tsadcv2_temp_to_code: invalid temperature, temp=700000 
error=1023
[  100.955598] thermal thermal_zone0: Failed to set trips: -34
===>　So rockchip thermal will return error.
