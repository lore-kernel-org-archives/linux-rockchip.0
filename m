To me it seems like perhaps cpufreq should not be changing frequencies
until it is resumed properly.  Presumably if all the ordering is done
right then cpufreq should be resumed _after_ the i2c regulator so you
should be OK.  ...or am I somehow confused about that?

Also note that previous i2c busses I worked with simply returned -EIO
in the case where they were called when suspended.  See
"i2c-exynos5.c" and "i2c-s3c2410.c".
