Thanks for the reference!  At the moment I'm not terribly worried
about this particular failure case (compared to other failure modes)
because it's rare and it self-heals.

...my best guess, though, is that the problem isn't exactly the same.
The "Firmware wakeup failed" is a pretty generic error message, kind
of like "something went wrong" and not all instances of this message
will have the same root cause.

I actually dealt with a few suspend/resume issues around mwifiex
recently though.  If you ever uprev, you might be interested in:
