The development rate is pretty low and maintainership is unclear but th=
e per-
soc voodoo is quite limited to the GEM-creation and everything else see=
ms=20
somewhat nice when compared for example to the older versions of the dd=
x.

I don't really understand that whole stack or how xservers work on a wh=
ole ;-)
I was merely able to make the _binary_ mali-driver work with this one a=
nd=20
remembered that there were hooks for future per-soc exa functions.

I guess for that glamor thing you'd need an actual gpu driver and not t=
hat=20
libGL-override voodoo those crazy binary drivers do.

At least the modesetting ddx didn't like mali-binary-driver.
