This is awfully noisy for something that pretty much all existing
boards will run.  debug level instead of info level?  Also:

* Don't split strings
across lines

* There's a magic % thing to get the name of an OF node.  Use that.

It's been a long time since I looked at this, but I could have sworn
that it was more complicated than that.  Specifically I though you
were supposed to query the eMMC card for what it supported and then
resolve that with what the host could support.

Assuming that this is supposed to be queried from the card (which is
how I remember it) then you definitely don't want it in the device
tree since you want to be able to stuff various different eMMC parts
and we should be able to figure out the impedance at runtime.


NOTE: IIRC the old value of 50 ohms is required to be supported by all
hosts and cards and is specified to be the default.


I do see at least the summary of what I thought of this before at
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9086541/>


(Sorry if the above is wrong and feel free to correct me--I don't have
time at the moment to do all the full research but hopefully you can
dig more based on my pointers.  Feel free to call me on my BS)
