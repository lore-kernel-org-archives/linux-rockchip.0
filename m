Ah.  Well, in this case it sounds like we've already got an
expectation of stable numbering from boot to boot.  I had missed Ulf's
patch, so I guess part 3 of my series isn't actually needed and can be
dropped.

So it's just a question of whether we allow people to manually specify
via device tree.


Note: if we really think using root=/dev/mmcblkNpM is a bad idea then
we should deprecate it and yell about it in the boot log.  Then 5 (or
20) years down the road we could remove the feature when the legacy
burden become a pain.  Note that even if we deprecated
root=/dev/mmcblkNpM I'd still love to see the numbering be consistent
to help folks parse dmesg.


Thanks for your thoughts!
