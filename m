It is not happening right now as far as I know.  ...but that's a bug.

Voltage when disabled and voltage when input are two different states.
A disabled PWM will typically either drive high or low (depending on
where it was when you turned it off).  Not all "disabled" states will
mean that the pin is configured as an input.
