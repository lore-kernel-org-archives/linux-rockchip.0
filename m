Shawn, I can't find an example of how you planned to use this (though I
can make educated guesses). As such, it's possible there's some
misunderstanding. Maybe you can include a sample patch for the PCIe
controller driver?

Related: it might make sense to have the PCIe controller and PHY
drivers/bindings all in the same patch series (with proper threading,
which we already talked about off-list).

My interpretation of the above is that Shawn means we might turn off up
to 3 different lanes (i.e., 3 of 4 supported lanes might be unused).

I'm not 100% sure I understand, but I think I have a reasonable
interpretation below.

My interpretation: rather than associating a single PCIe controller
device with a single struct phy that controls up to 4 lanes, Kishon is
suggesting you should have this driver implement 4 phy objects, one for
each lane. You'd need to add #phy-cells =3D <1> to the DT binding, and
implement an ->of_xlate() hook so we can associate/address them
properly. Then the PCIe controller would call phy_power_off() on each
lane that's not used.

The state machine would come into play because you have additional powe=
r
savings to utilize, but only when all PHYs are off. So the state machin=
e
would just track how many of the lane PHYs are still on, and when the
count reaches 0, you call reset_control_assert(rk_phy->phy_rst).

The DT for this would be:

	pcie0: pcie@f8000000 {
		compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-pcie";
		...
		phys =3D <&pcie_phy 0>, <&pcie_phy 1>, <&pcie_phy 2>, <&pcie_phy 3>;
		phy-names =3D "pcie-lane0", "pcie-lane1", "pcie-lane2", "pcie-lane3";
		...
	};

	pcie_phy: pcie-phy {
		compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-pcie-phy";
		...
		#phy-cells =3D <1>;
		...
	};

(See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt for the
#phy-cells explanation.)

Is that close to what you're suggesting, Kishon? Seems reasonable enoug=
h
to me, even if it's slightly more complicated.
