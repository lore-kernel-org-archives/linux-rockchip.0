Coincidentally I looked into this issue last week when testing my
PCIe patches on RK3588 EVB1 instead of RK3576 and fixed it up from
the clock path. From my perspective the root cause is with the clock
registered by the PHY driver. The clock consumer expects it to be
running when the enable function succeeds and in case of the PHY
that is not true for the suspend resume path. The PHY just ungates
the clock, but does not take care of resuming the "parent" PLL.

I've not yet send out the fix, but you you can find v0 here (part
of the rockchip-devel branch):

https://gitlab.collabora.com/hardware-enablement/rockchip-3588/linux/-/comm=
it/53014abcf948b7afcb2150ea690a8f6062cf66a6

mainline still lacks my RK3588/RK3576 PCIe suspend patches (I plan
to send a new version this week). Thus with pure mainline the PCIe
driver will block the RK3588 from going into suspend in the first
place.

FWIW There is also a bunch of other bugs around system suspend on
RK3588; most of them are less critical though. Also some BL31
firmwares seem to be broken.
