The patch is self-descriptive. I've found that we may need
platform-specific behavior for the PERST# signal in system suspend,
depending on the type of PCIe endpoints are attached.

@@ -24,3 +24,14 @@ driver implementation may support the following properties:
    unsupported link speed, for instance, trying to do training for

+- pcie-reset-suspend:
+   If present this property defines whether the PCIe Reset signal (referred to
+   as PERST#) should be asserted when the system enters low-power suspend modes
+   (e.g., S3). Depending on the form factor, the associated PCIe
+   electromechanical specification may specify a particular behavior (e.g.,
+   "PERST# is asserted in advance of the power being switched off in a
+   power-managed state like S3") or it may be less clear. The net result is
+   that some endpoints perform better (e.g., lower power consumption) with
+   PERST# asserted, and others prefer PERST# deasserted. The value must be '0'
+   or '1', where '0' means do not assert PERST# and '1' means assert PERST#.
+   When absent, behavior may be platform-specific.
