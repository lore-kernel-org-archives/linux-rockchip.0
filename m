Thanks for this patch :-)

I 'reported' the issue based on the logs I saw from other people, but
now that I have a RockPro64 (version 2.1) myself, I can confirm that
without this patch I saw those warnings myself.

When booted up without a PCIe card in the slot, I also saw these errors:
[    5.106650] rockchip-pcie f8000000.pcie: PCIe link training gen1 timeout=
!
[    5.107373] rockchip-pcie f8000000.pcie: probe with driver rockchip-pcie=
 failed with error -110

You indicated that that was due to there being no PCIe card inserted.

After applying this patch I booted up my RockPro64 and found that the
above mentioned warnings are indeed gone.

Then I inserted a Renesas Electronics Corp. uPD720201 USB 3.0 Host
Controller in the PCIe slot and booted up.
The above mentioned errors were indeed gone.
Furthermore ``lspci`` showed that card and when I plugged in an USB 3
drive in one of the ports, it was correctly detected and I could mount
the partition on my system. So feel free to include:
