It was, but with a different definition of alphabetical order.  ;)
"syscon" (s) comes after "regmap" (r).  ...but your way is better,
you're right.

I'm afraid I don't understand.  Can you elaborate?  Are you saying if
things weren't broken then we wouldn't have to ask the common clock
framework for this?  Where would we get this value?

=2E..or are you suggesting that in other SoCs you wouldn't need to set
corecfg_baseclkfreq because it would be somehow automatic?  If that's
so then those SoCs should just set -1 for "shift" in their map and
this function will be a no-op.

I don't see a reason to check the return code here.  Specifically:

* If this is a SoC where you don't need to write corecfg_baseclkfreq
then we need do nothing about this error.

* If the regmap write failed (which would be terribly unexpected for a
memory mapped register) then we've already printed an error (in
sdhci_arasan_syscon_write).  Best course of action seems to keep going
and try anyway.


I don't think a retry is likely to help anything.

IMHO it doesn't hurt to do this for all SoCs.  This will help
facilitate other SoCs adding their own syscon so that they can
properly modify corecfg registers.

I can't say that I know anything about the other Arasan PHYs, but
presumably they also have corecfg registers.  If/when maps are added
for SoCs including those PHYs then this would be useful for them.

If you want I could change the code to only call of_parse_phandle if
"sdhci_arasan->soc_ctl_map" was non-NULL, but that should have no
functional change since we'll never actually use the syscon if we have
no map.
