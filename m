Thanks.

I usually follow the text above and type in text mode. I am made to suffer
a Microsoft Exchange server in between me and the open world and I have
no control if it decides to reformat the message. It is by no means
my intent to type everything in one line but I also choose sometime to
have longer lines if I believe that it helps the readability of the text.

I did not say of_node_get() I said "some reference counting of sorts".
One option would be to have (yet) another callback that the user of the
components framework has to provide that does resource management. And for
the record, I did thought about it and not for just a few minutes. I also
came out of the thought process with the conclusion that while the components
framework is doing the job it was coded for, it needs serious improvements
in terms of documentation.

Russell, I have no idea what do I need to do in order to gain your respect
and for you to start treating me like a human being. Maybe *I* need to
lower my expectations and stop hoping to have a civilised discussion with
you.

No. It is utterly insane not to have documentation when using the framework
or the function leads to memory leaks. You can say "If you use
component_match_add() you need to provide a callback for resource management
if your X or Y or Z needs such operations". The current components framework
is seriously in need of documentation. To borrow your language, look at the
crap one needs to put up with when starting to use the framework: to be a
component one needs to fill the component_ops structure. This is its
definition:

struct component_ops {
	int (*bind)(struct device *, struct device *, void *);
	void (*unbind)(struct device *, struct device *, void *);
};

Note that there are no names associated with the parameters and no documentation
to allow one to distinguish between the two struct device pointers. You have
to look at component_bind() to learn that first parameter is a component's
dev part and the second is the master's dev part.

You might think that the code is the proper documentation and ultimately that
is right, but even code is wrong sometimes and (as we discovered with the
component_match_add() discussion here) its side effects are not easy to spot
even to the authors of the code.

So, yes, we do need documentation, even if it is insane, because it tells us
how insanely fragile the code is. Even God, through Moses, has tersely
documented his Operating System through the 10 commandments.

Another example: of the 6 commits for drivers/base/component.c, 3 of them
have "fixed ... handling/cleanup/bug". So it is not easy to get it right.

No, I was operating under the belief that if some framework holds a pointer
to a resource it should also do the management of that resource. Your
choice for the component framework has been different and you have decided
that it is just a conduit for data gathering and binding, without any deep
knowledge of what that data is. But that is not documented anywhere, so I
don't feel too bad about having a different view.

I understand your point. You have also written some excellent piece of
documentation for the behaviour of the component framework that I feel
should be included in the kernel rather than being lost in the sea of emails.
