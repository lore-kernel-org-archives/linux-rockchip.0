This series contains a few misc clock cleanups for Rockchip rk3288
found by comparing to what's in the downstream Chrome OS 3.14 kernel.

NOTES:
* The PWM patches could go in separately from the revert but that
  would cause a merge conflict which is why they're together in a
  series.
* Having the PWM marked as a critical clock _definitely_ needs to land
  before switching the clock in the device tree.

  ARM: dts: rockchip: fix PWM clock found on RK3288 Socs

Douglas Anderson (2):
  Revert "clk: rockchip: mark noc and some special clk as critical on
    rk3288"
  clk: rockchip: Make rkpwm a critical clock on rk3288
