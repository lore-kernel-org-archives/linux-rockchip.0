That's a valid concern, but such scenarios shouldn't happen by
design, unless there's some bug, of course.

Yes, users don't _have_ to upgrade their firmware, as described
above in more detail, but they actually _should_ upgrade.  In fact,
they should be happy and eager to upgrade. :)

Hmm, I don't think that keeping older DTs around is a good idea.
Instead, we should simply document the required kernel version,
or even better, make some kind of a dependency between the firmware
version and the version of the kernel packages.  The latter is,
of course, a much more complex option, but also better.

For the record, please note that I have zero interest whatsoever
in any kind of "full-fat" UEFI firmware implementation.

Well, it's perfectly reasonable to expect the users to install
different Linux distributions, etc.  However, as already described
above, running a newer kernel version without updating the firmware
should never lead to such issues.

I think we should raise the awareness of the actual benefits coming
from the openness of firmware on various ARM boards, and the available
choice of _not_ having to use "full-fat" UEFI firmware, instead of
trying to make the whole thing be more like x86_64 UEFI firmware.
