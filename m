The px30 contains 2 separate clock controllers the regular cru creating
most clocks as well as the pmucru managing the GPLL and some other clocks.

The gpll of course also is needed by the cru, so while we normally do rely
on clock names to associate clocks getting probed later on (for example
xin32k coming from an i2c device in most cases) it is safer to declare the
explicit dependency between the two crus. This makes sure that for example
the clock-framework probes them in the correct order from the start.

The assigned-clocks properties were simply working by chance in the past
so split them accordingly to the 2 crus to honor the loading direction.
