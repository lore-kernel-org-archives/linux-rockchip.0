Okay, if it looks different then good enough for me.

Just leave them for now.

Generally, you have 'ports' when there is more than one 'port' node
which you should in this case.

grep hdmi-connector in the tree there's lot's of examples.

Yes, that's the input side. And generally, muxing is represented as
multiple endpoints.

Not all cases of HDMI have defined a connector node as that came along later.
