Previously I though other bits might be able to reference from syscon10, 
other than GPIO_MUTE alone.
If it is renamed to gpio-mute, then the GPIO_MUTE pin is accessed as 
`<&gpio-mute 1>`. Yet other
bits in syscon10 can also be referenced, say, `<&gpio-mute 10>`, which 
is not good.

I'd like to add a `gpio,syscon-bit` property to gpio-syscon, which 
overrides the properties
of bit_count,  data_bit_offset and dir_bit_offset in the driver. For 
example:

                 gpio_mute: gpio-mute {
                         compatible = "rockchip,gpio-syscon";
                         gpio-controller;
                         #gpio-cells = <2>;
                         gpio,syscon-dev = <0 0x0428 0>;
                         gpio,syscon-bit = <1 1 0>;
                 };

That way, the mute pin is strictly specified as <&gpio_mute 0>, and 
<&gpio_mute 1> will be invalid.
I think that is neat, and consistent with the gpio_mute name.

Thanks
Levin
