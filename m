My point is that even though the test strategy might be considered a
"property" of the kernel, how you execute it is definitely not and you
will have as many setups as you have CI farms. You can't put that into
the kernel, just like we don't put the kernel command line in it for
example.

The existence of that branch in itself is an issue to me. Again, it's a
matter of trust. How can I trust a branch I barely know about, of which
the development is not clear and isn't reviewed by any of the
maintainers of the code that might affect the test outcomes.

Or put another way, if I run the tests on my machine, it won't work. Why
should it work on the CI farm? The branch itself is broken. It might not
be due to any of the work I did, but it's broken still.

I agree that we need a baseline, but that baseline should be defined by
the tests own merits, not their outcome on a particular platform.

In other words, I want all drivers to follow that baseline, and if they
don't it's a bug we should fix, and we should be vocal about it. We
shouldn't ignore the test because it's broken.

Going back to the example I used previously, kms_hdmi_inject@inject-4k
shouldn't fail on mt8173, ever. That's a bug. Ignoring it and reporting
that "all tests are good" isn't ok. There's something wrong with that
driver and we should fix it.

Or at the very least, explain in much details what is the breakage, how
we noticed it, why we can't fix it, and how to reproduce it.

Because in its current state, there's no chance we'll ever go over that
test list and remove some of them. Or even know if, if we ever fix a bug
somewhere, we should remove a flaky or failing test.

Thanks for the reality check, but it's very much doable: we're in
control of the test suite.

I think we have somewhat contradicting goals. You want to make
regression testing, so whatever test used to work in the past should
keep working. That's fine, but it's different from "expectations about
what the DRM drivers are supposed to pass in the IGT test suite" which
is about validation, ie "all KMS drivers must behave this way".

I guess for regression you very much would like that all-green
dashboard, and it's understandable. For validation, we don't care and we
should be as vocal as possible to report broken drivers.

Eventually, we should have regression testing over the validation test
suite.

It's not about reality. We should be clear what we expect from those
test suites, and not claim that it's something it's not.

I'm sure it works great for Mesa, but I'm also sure it doesn't ignore
CTS reports that a particular device isn't a valid OpenGL or Vulkan
implementation anymore.

We would too if the test was reported as failed. But our preferred
approach to do so diverge.
