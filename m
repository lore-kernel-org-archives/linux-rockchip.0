Ok, I have tested without it too and it works with a small hack on the =
code.
Agree with you

Hack is used to because when sdio subsystem compare the wifi voltage ca=
pability
returned by a specific message on the bus with the possible voltage lev=
els that
hardware connection provides and take the minimal. The card return to s=
upport
from 2V up and this is the reason to declare it at 2V. I will retest ag=
ain

Perfect, I will retest as soon as I can and go back to you. Right now
I have two hardware design around firefly that use the wifi
