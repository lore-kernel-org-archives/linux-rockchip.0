Of_clk_init is called early, and platform_device_register_simple should=
=20
be called after devices_init, it will be failed to do it from clk-code.
So we need add a new file or add module_init to each clock controller=20
driver(like clk-rk3368.c, clk-rk3399.c) ?

Rockchip-cpufreq.c depends on ARM_ROCKCHIP_CPUFREQ, it will not be=20
compiled on non-Rockchip platforms.
The driver can support all Rockchip SoCs up to now, add=20
of_machine_is_compatible may be redundant ?
