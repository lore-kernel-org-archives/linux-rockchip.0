As the first line describes, this GPIO controller is dedicated for the 
GPIO_MUTE pin.
There's only one GPIO pin in the GRF_SOC_CON10 register. Therefore the 
gpio_mute
name is proper IMHO.

Thanks for pointing that out. So it should be:

    The GPIO_MUTE pin is referred to as <&gpio_mute 0 POLARITY>.


Thanks,
