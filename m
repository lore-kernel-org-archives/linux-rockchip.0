ok, that would make sense to make that a bit more visible, and it
would even require functional changes ;-)

as the driver currently stands (without my changes) every phy is seen as
the same function block - it looks like phy0...phy2 have the same
functionality and the driver cannot distinguish between them. The
similarity is true for SIDDQ and some other generic bits (even across
different Rockchip SoCs), but for more special functionality bits move
their location between phys. This is even more visisble if you compare
rk3066/rk3188/rk3288 phys.

What I mean, and would like to have for the new phy-IP for rk3368 etc
would be to have one node, then do the reference via an index like 
<&usbphy 1> and hide the internals in the driver instead of having
that in the dts.

That's why it's nice to be able to reidentify the phy in the driver again
via the register/structs introduced, because now you can again know that
phyX is actually the OTG phy etc.
