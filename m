Have you tried adding an mclk-fs setting to the simple-audio-card?  You
probably want to set it to 256, which will allow 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz
and 96kHz at the codec.  This will give more functionality than pinning
the clock to a specific rate.

For the Rock2 Square, I write a machine driver for the sound because the
headphone GPIO setup cannot be made to work with simple-audio-card; I
found the Firefly Reload schematic and it looks like the configuration
hardware is very similar.  It's a bit of a mess but you can find it on
Github [1] if you want to take a look.
