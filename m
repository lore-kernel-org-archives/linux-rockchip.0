The i915 code around this is already a big mess, and I don't really
adding to that mess. So I think we'll need to do some refactoring before
we add anything there. I already started typing something and so far
it looks fairly straightforward, so I should have something soon.

While doing that several questions came to my mind though:

* More interactions with the colorspace property, but I sent
  a separate mail already about that

* Which conversion matrix to use, and the answer I suspect
  should be "ask the colorspace property", as mentioned in the
  other mail

* Should we flat out reject color formats (and I suppose also
  colorspace prop values) the sink doesn't claim to support?

  If yes, then I think we'll have to forget about adding anything =

  to i915 MST code. The way the MST stuff works is that if one
  stream needs a modeset then all the related streams get modeset
  as well. Thus if the user replaces a monitor getting fed with a
  YCbCr stream just as another stream is being modeset, then the
  entire atomic commit could fail due to the YCbCr stream getting
  rejected.

  I think eventually we might have to invent some mechanism where
  all the input into the modeset computation is cached somehow,
  and said cache updated only on explicit userspace modesets.
  Either that or we have to come up  with a way to skip some of
  the calculations that depend on external factors. Either way
  it's going to be a pain.

  OTOH if we don't mind feeding the sink with stuff it can't
  understand, then I suppose we might add YCbCr 4:4:4 support
  for MST. It shouldn't be any different from RGB apart from
  the RGB->YCbCr conversion, which is handled elsewhere. But
  YCbCr 4:2:0 is definitely out either way, the MST code has
  no support for that currently.
