It would make sense to me to have a DT property in the PCIe host
controller object that describes how that controller works, including
its capabilities with respect to PERST#, assuming there's a reasonable
way to use that information.

If there's a DT way to describe a hard-wired PCIe endpoint, it might
make sense to have a second property in the endpoint object that
describes its preferences.  Obviously this couldn't apply to slots
where we don't know what might be plugged in.

I'm not sure how this would work out.  I can see the quirk side (e.g.,
the quirk could set a bit in the root port), but who would consume it?
Would every host bridge driver have to look at the bit?  This doesn't
feel like a generic model that works well across vendors.

If devices rely on things not specified by the spec, they will work
better on some systems than on others.  That feels like an issue for
the vendors, not for us.

Obviously you want to tweak something for your particular
configuration, and you can do that either via out-of-tree code or via
some more generic way that I haven't seen yet.
