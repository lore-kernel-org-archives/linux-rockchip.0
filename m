I applied these to pci/host-rockchip except for these:

  PCI: rockchip: fix system hang up if activating CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ
  PCI: rockchip: fix missing phy manipulation for legacy phy

I'm not really happy with the devm/clk_prepare_enable situation, so
I'm waiting to see if a better solution emerges.

I went ahead and applied the tweaks I proposed to the earlier "PCI:
rockchip: Add per-lane PHY support" and "PCI: rockchip: Idle inactive
PHY(s)" patches.  I *think* those make the "fix missing phy
manipulation for legacy phy" patch unnecessary.

But please take a look and make sure.  If I went the wrong direction,
I'll gladly back it out.

Bjorn
