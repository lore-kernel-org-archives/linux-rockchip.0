Hi Brain, Doug and Heiko,

I would like to summarize why this story was constructed.

The ehci/ohci-platform suspend process are blocked due to UTMI clock 
which directly output from usb-phy has been disabled, and why the UTMI 
clock was disabled?

UTMI clock and 480m clock all output from the same internal PLL of 
usb-phy, and there is only one bit can use to control this PLL on or 
off, which we named "otg_commononn"(GRF, offset 0x0e450/0x0e460 bit4 ) 
in RK3399 TRM.

When system boot up, ehci/ohci-platform probe function invoke 
phy_power_on(), further invoke rockchip_usb2phy_power_on() to enable 
480m clock, actually, it sets the otg_commononn bit on, and then usb-phy 
will go to (auto)suspend if there is no devices plug-in after 1 minute, 
the rockchip_usb2phy_power_off() will be invoked and the 480m clock may 
be disabled in the (auto)suspend process. As a result, the otg_commononn 
bit may be turned off, and all output clock of usb-phy will be disabled. 
However, ehci/ohci-platform PM suspend operation (read/write controller 
register) are based on the UTMI clock.

So we introduced "clk_usbphy0_480m_src"/"clk_usbphy1_480m_src" as one 
input clock for ehci/ohci-platform, in this way, the otg_commononn bit 
is not turned off until ehci/ohci-platform go to PM suspend.
