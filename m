Ah, got it.  I think I missed that you considered pwm_get_period()
legacy and that you eventually wanted to get rid of it.  OK, then what
you say makes sense.

IMHO this is a change in behavior that will break existing users.
Anyone using a PWM regulator will suddenly find their voltage changing
at bootup.  Certainly today all users of the PWM regulator don't seem
to mind (apparently) the the voltage is reported incorrectly at bootup
but I bet they'd mind if the voltage suddenly started changing for
them at bootup.

It seems better to preserve existing behavior and print a warning that
the voltage will be reported incorrectly until HW Readout is
supported.

Of course, we're only talking about two real users in mainline here:
Rockchip boards and the "stih407-family".  If we just fix both of
those to support HW Readout before landing the change then I'm fine
with doing what you say.

I had missed the part where you wanted to deprecate pwm_get_period().
Thus my points here aren't really valid.

In my mind the old API was perfectly fine (and actually quite clean /
simple to use) except in the special case of avoiding the PWM
regulator glitches.  With that mindset I think my previous email make
sense.  However, this is your subsystem to maintain and if you think
moving everyone to a new atomic API makes more sense then you're in
the best position to make that decision.  :)
