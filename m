please try to always include both me and the linux-rockchip list for Ro=
ckchip=20
specific changes in the future :-) .

In any case, I do think going with a reg property might be more standar=
d=20
conformant, once it is under the GRF. Of course only for sub-devices th=
at=20
actually occupy a real block inside the GRF like your emmc phy or the n=
ew=20
usbphy blocks.

So I guess the dts should probably look like:


grf: syscon@ff770000 {
	compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	#address-cells =3D <1>;
	#size-cells =3D <1>;

	emmcphy: phy@f780 {
		compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-emmc-phy";
		reg =3D <0xf780 0x20>;
		#phy-cells =3D <0>;
	};
 };

I just saw I missed to remove that now obsolete rockchip,grf property.
