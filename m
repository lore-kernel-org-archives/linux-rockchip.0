As you can see in the follow-up patches, the fractional dividers on Roc=
kchip=20
SoCs are quite strange in that they even need to have their _downstream=
_ mux=20
point to them to actually accept rate changes.

The register value always reflects the value set by the system, but har=
dware=20
really only accepts it if the clock is enabled and even the downstream =
mux=20
selects the fractional divider as parent (they call it a auto-gating fe=
ature).

So in the worst (and current) case, you end up with the register showin=
g the=20
right value, but the hardware can use completely different dividers fro=
m the=20
previous setting.

That strange behaviour got quite deeply investigated between Rockchip a=
nd=20
Google engineers who stumbled upon this in the first place, so I'm reas=
onably=20
sure this is the right solution for that clock type :-) .
