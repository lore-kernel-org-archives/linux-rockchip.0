I'm confused, what are you trying to do?

It seems that we already have:

vm_insert_page() - returns an errno
vmf_insert_page() - returns a VM_FAULT_* code

From what I _think_ you're saying, you're trying to provide
vm_insert_kmem_page() as a direct replacement for the existing
vm_insert_page(), and then make vm_insert_page() behave as per
vmf_insert_page(), so we end up with:

vm_insert_kmem_page() - returns an errno
vm_insert_page() - returns a VM_FAULT_* code
vmf_insert_page() - returns a VM_FAULT_* code and is identical to
      vm_insert_page()

Given that the documentation for vm_insert_page() says:

 * Usually this function is called from f_op->mmap() handler
 * under mm->mmap_sem write-lock, so it can change vma->vm_flags.
 * Caller must set VM_MIXEDMAP on vma if it wants to call this
 * function from other places, for example from page-fault handler.

this says that the "usual" use method for vm_insert_page() is
_outside_ of page fault handling - if it is used _inside_ page fault
handling, then it states that additional fixups are required on the
VMA.  So I don't get why your patch commentry seems to be saying that
users of vm_insert_page() outside of page fault handling all need to
be patched - isn't this the use case that this function is defined
to be handling?

If you're going to be changing the semantics, doesn't this create a
flag day where we could get new users of vm_insert_page() using the
_existing_ semantics merged after you've changed its semantics (eg,
the return code)?

Maybe I don't understand fully what you're trying to achieve here.
