Just to sketch the rough idea: A list of known shared media graphs in
drivers/media/mc/mc-shared-graph.c:

struct mcshgr_info { ... } known_graphs  = {
	{
		.id = MEDIA_SHARED_ROCKCHIP_RK3588_CAMERA,
		.name = "Rockchip Camera Subsystem",
		// TODO fill me with other things
	},
	{
		.id = MEDIA_SHARED_ROCKCHIP_RK3576_CAMERA,
		.name  = "whatever",
		// TODO fill me with other things
	},
};

The IDs need to go into a enum in include/media/mc-shared-graph.h.

The drivers would then call e.g.
	mdev = media_device_shared_join(rkcif->dev,
		MEDIA_SHARED_ROCKCHIP_RK3588_CAMERA);
and of course this parameter could vary with the individual driver DT
compatible, e.g., "rockchip,rk3588-vicap" =>
MEDIA_SHARED_ROCKCHIP_RK3588_CAMERA.

I am sketching this for the sake of completeness. This would provide a
place to store information, but I am not convinced at all that this is a
nice solution.

Alternatively, the list of known shared media graphs could store some DT
compatibles

struct mcshgr_info { ... } known_graphs  = {
	{
		.id = MEDIA_SHARED_ROCKCHIP_RK3588_CAMERA,
		.name = "Rockchip Camera Subsystem",
		.compatibles = {
			"rockchip,rk3588-isp",
			"rockchip,rk3588-vicap",
		},
		// TODO fill me with other things
	},
};
and I guess there could be a way to get the compatible from struct
device, then
	mdev = media_device_shared_join(rkcif->dev);
would remain the same.

This just occurred to me -- not sure whether I like it.

How to get information that the media device requires or at least
contains as of today.

They may be, at least as of today. I was asking myself how our view on
the new (shared) media device should look like. And I think that the
concept of the graph is important, and that the focus should be on which
entities there are and how the are connected (i.e, the topology, the
graph). This also means that we should not rely on other information and
assumptions (other information such as media device name, hw version,
... and assumptions such as "there is a single v4l2 driver that owns the
graph", "there is a single media device that owns the graph", ...)

In the end, what should user space do? Does libcamera actually do
anything with e.g. the HW revision of a media device? Is the name of the
media device actually used?

Or does it simply iterate over all media devices and scan for entities
with a certain name (e.g. look for a RK3588 ISP)? Because if it does, or
if it could do it that way, there is no point in crafting together this
additional information in the kernel.

Then we set the dev member of the media_device to NULL, right?

Crafting together a name from device tree information... could work..
and could be reasonable I guess. Just saying that if some joker removes
the connection between ISP and VICAP in device tree, the media graph
could end up with the same name for different things or different things
with the same name and... I just think I this all is not something I
would rely on from user space, and I would look at the graph rather than
making assumptions based on the graph name.

The real question is whether this is actually needed. As you stated
above, maybe this simply doesn't make sense for a shared media graph.
And we still have the individual IP core information.

I would recommend to ignore the fields listed above for shared media
devices.
