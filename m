Hi Kishon,

Could you kindly have a look at this patchset and give a 'yes' or 'no'
to this solution? Your opinion is the most important ont for it, otherwise
we should invent other bits to implement it.

This patchset is trying to reconstruct PCIe and PCIe-PHY driver
for rockchip platform in order to support per-lane PHY mode. And
we could idle the inactive lane(s) finally.

We deprecate the legacy PHY mode but the code could still
support it in order not to break backware compatibility of DTB. And I
organize the patches carefully so that we don't introduce git-bisect
issue.

Patchset was reviewed by Brian and fully tested by Jeffy. Rob acked
patch 6 & 7. Patch 5 for DTS changes for Rockchip part still need
ack from Heiko, and it would be fine for Heiko to pick it up after
pcie and pcie-phy changes got merged.


Changes in v4:
- use err variable to check return value of
  rockchip_pcie_get_phys
- add Brian's tag
- move rockchip_pcie_get_phys to where it stands in
  patch 1.
- print PHY index in err output log
- return u8 for rockchip_pcie_lane_map

Changes in v3:
- kill rockchip_pcie_manipulate_phys and related stuff
- use phys array
- improve the commit msg
- remove unnecessary forward declaration
- keep mutex inside struct rockchip_pcie_phy
- fix wrong check of args number
- move de-idle lanes after deasserting the reset
- use cached lanes_map to avoid powering off inactive
  lanes twice
- rename the commit tile

Changes in v2:
- deprecate legacy PHY model
- improve rockchip_pcie_phy_of_xlate
- fix wrong calculation of pwr_cnt and add new init_cnt
- add internal locking
- introduce per-lane data to simply the code

Shawn Lin (7):
  PCI: rockchip: split out rockchip_pcie_get_phys
  PCI: rockchip: introduce per-lanes PHYs support
  phy: rockcip-pcie: reconstruct driver to support per-lane PHYs
  PCI: rockchip: idle the inactive PHY(s)
  arm64: dts: rockchip: convert PCIe to use per-lane PHYs for rk3339
  dt-bindings: PCI: rockchip: convert to use per-lane PHY model
  dt-bindings: phy: convert to use per-lane Rockchip PCIe PHY
