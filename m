I was proposing changing the PHY to look like:

usbphy: phy {
  compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-usb-phy";
  rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
  #address-cells = <1>;
  #size-cells = <1>;
  status = "disabled";

  usbphy0: usb-phy0 {
    #phy-cells = <0>;
    reg = <0x320 0x14>;
    clocks = <&cru SCLK_OTGPHY0>;
    clock-names = "phyclk";
  };
  ...
};

...in other words change the "size-cells" for the main PHY to 1 and
add a length to the registers.

Yeah, that would work.  I was just trying to make it more obvious in
the DTS that there was actually a range of registers managed here...

Now it's my turn: I'm not sure I understand...  ;)
