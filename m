I met this in bcmdhd driver, it seems upstream brcmfmac driver don't
have this problem.

======================================================================
void bcmsdh_oob_intr_unregister(bcmsdh_info_t *bcmsdh)
{
    int err = 0;
    bcmsdh_os_info_t *bcmsdh_osinfo = bcmsdh->os_cxt;

    SDLX_MSG(("%s: Enter\n", __FUNCTION__));
    if (!bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_registered) {
        SDLX_MSG(("%s: irq is not registered\n", __FUNCTION__));
    return;
}
    if (bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_wake_enabled) {
    err = disable_irq_wake(bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_num);
    if (!err)
        bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_wake_enabled = FALSE;
    }
    if (bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_enabled) {
        disable_irq(bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_num);
        bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_enabled = FALSE;
    }
    free_irq(bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_num, bcmsdh);
    bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_registered = FALSE;
}
======================================================================
In this funciton, it will disable irq before free_irq.
At first, i think that commenting the line
"disable_irq(bcmsdh_osinfo->oob_irq_num);" can slove this problem,
but actually this driver have many hidden calls to disable_irq and
hardlly to correct....

Besides, I think that umask() and mask() aren't supposed to be strict symmetric.

Yes, it's pretty hacky, but i think it can work stable since this
condition only take effect when disbale_irq + free_irq was called.
