I've just submitted v5.  For some reason the link to the cover letter [1]
doesn't seem to work, I'm getting:

  Message-ID <20260304-vdec-reg-order-rk3576-v5-0-7006fad42c3a@collabora.com>
  not found

But all the others are just fine, e.g. [2] is the for the 1st patch.  I've never
encountered something similar before.

Regards,
Cristian
