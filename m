OK, so that could solve the "Kconfig" problem.

So if you're on a board that doesn't use EDP but uses LVDS then their
suspend/resume should be broken?

Specifically, it's my understanding that on this SoC:

1. There's a single "video IO" power domain that contains things like
the video output processor, EDP, LVDS, HDMI, etc.

2. When you turn on/off the power domain it's important to clock all
devices in the domain during the reset.

3. If you don't clock all devices during the reset they get left in a
"wedged" state.

4. If you try to do things like suspend/resume it will query all
devices.  If they've been left in the wedged state then suspend/resume
will be blocked.

...so this problem is still not solved.

In this case if we're using LVDS and HDMI on a system, we don't want
the EDP clock always on (that just wastes power).  We just need to
clock it for the power domain transition.


Note that nothing in the above solves the problem that not all clocks
for a given device need to be turned on during power domain
transitions.  If we're trying to describe hardware perfectly, we'd
really need to add to each device:

clocks = <clk1>, <clk2>, <clk3>, ...
clock-names = "name1", "name2", "name3", ...
clocks-for-power-domain-transition = "name2", "name3";

...since perhaps the clock named "name1" isn't required for power
domain transitions and so shouldn't be turned on.  Note that once
we're going through and adding a special list, it doesn't seem that
different than just adding the list in the power domain node instead
(other than being more complex).
