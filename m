Well, the Plextor NVMe drive used to work with previous kernels,
but regressed.

But yes, the delay was added to enforce "PCIe r6.0, sec 6.6.1"
requirement for software to wait 100ms, which once again makes
the Plextor NVMe drive work.

In dw_pcie_wait_for_link(), in the first iteration of the loop, the link
will never be up (because the link was just started),
dw_pcie_wait_for_link() will then sleep for LINK_WAIT_SLEEP_MS (90 ms),
before trying again.

Most likely the link training took way less than 100 ms, so most of those
90 ms will probably be after link training has completed.

That is most likely why Plextor worked on older kernels (which does not
use the link up IRQ).

If we add a 100 ms sleep after wait_for_link(), then I suggest that we
also reduce LINK_WAIT_SLEEP_MS to something shorter.

I agree, sounds like a plan.

I think it sounds good to target this as fixes for v6.16.

Do you plan to send out something after -rc1, or do you prefer me to do it?


Kind regards,
