Agree with you!

Is this necessary? I mean, the drivers that will use PWM modes could be
updated to use 4 cells or not. For these drivers I created a generic OF
parse function which parse everything. This is currently on my local branch
only (previous approach to have a common parse function for all driver wasn't
well accepted):

struct pwm_device *
of_pwm_xlate_all(struct pwm_chip *pc, const struct of_phandle_args *args)
{
	struct pwm_device *pwm;
	enum pwm_mode mode;

	/* check, whether the driver supports all cells */
	if (pc->of_pwm_n_cells < 4)
		return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

	/* flags in the third and fourth cells are optional */
	if (args->args_count < 2)
		return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

	if (args->args[0] >= pc->npwm)
		return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

	pwm = pwm_request_from_chip(pc, args->args[0], NULL);
	if (IS_ERR(pwm))
		return pwm;

	pwm->args.period = args->args[1];
	pwm->args.polarity = PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL;
	pwm->args.mode = BIT(ffs(pwm->chip->caps->modes) - 1);

	switch (args->args_count) {
	case 3:
		mode = BIT(ffs(args->args[3]) - 1);
		if (pwm_mode_valid(pwm->chip, mode))
			pwm->args.mode = mode;

	case 2:
		if (args->args[2] & PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED)
			pwm->args.polarity = PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED;
		break;

	default:
		break;
	}

	return pwm;
}

Drivers which uses PWM mode could use this generic parse function.
In case of using old DT binaries, with no PWM mode bindings, and with
- a driver that support PWM modes, the pwm->args will be initialized
with PWM mode normal (the default for every PWM controller).

In case the driver haven't specific support for PWM modes (so it support
only PWM normal mode) there is no need to update to 4 cells. The
of_pwm_xlate_with_flags() or
of_pwm_simple_xlate()
could be used to parse DT bindings (with some little changes to also update
the PWM mode for pwm->args). Currently I have this line to be added, in these
two functions, in next version for this series:

pwm->args.mode = BIT(ffs(pwm->chip->caps->modes) - 1);

I did some tests on my side and it looks ok.

Please correct me if I'm saying something wrong.

No there is no need to set the mode explicitly. The implicit mode is normal
mode. If other mode needs to be set then the mode cells (or the mode inserted
in the flag cells as you wish) should take care of this.

But these modes seem like a

of PWM controller. I'm saying about PWM push-pull mode. Also about PWM controllers
with 2 outputs per PWM channel.

Regarding the other modes I had a discussion with Thierry, back in time, regarding
this (see [1]) where he asked me to add these normal and complementary modes
before adding push-pull mode in order to differentiate b/w PWM controllers with
one output and PWM controllers with 2 outputs per PWM channel so that the PWM
user to be aware of how its PWM channel works.

Agree! The chip registered with COMPLEMENTARY and PUSH-PULL modes was just
an example.

Also, agree!

registered for the channel of a PWM controller which has only one output
will also involve some control of the external h/w that is doing push-pull.
For instance, I'm talking about a schema like this:

+---------------+
|               | ch0   +-----------+       __          __
|               |------>| push-pull |---> _|  |________|  |____
|PWM controller |       | external  |             __           __
|               |       | module    |---> _______|  |_________|  |__
|               |       +-----------+
+---------------+

From my point of view, for this kind of schematic having the PWM channel controller
supporting all the modes (normal, complementary, push-pull) will be useless without
a way to control the push-pull external module (e.g. a GPIO).
