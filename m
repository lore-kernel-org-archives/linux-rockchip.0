Hi Mark,
Thanks for getting back to this.

Ah, OK. I mean that rockchip_crtc_wait_for_update takes a drm_crtc
pointer, and establishes the state from that (e.g.
crtc->primary->state). This can easily lead to confusion in async
contexts, as the states attached to a drm_crtc and a drm_plane can
change here while you wait for it.

It would be better if the call was:

for_each_plane_in_state(state, plane, plane_state, i) {
    if (plane->type =3D=3D DRM_PLANE_TYPE_PRIMARY)
        rockchip_crtc_wait_for_update(plane_state->crtc, plane_state);
}

This way it is very clear, and there is no confusion as to which
request we are waiting to complete.

In general, using crtc->state or plane->state is a very bad idea,
_except_ in the atomic_check function where you are calculating
changes (e.g. if (plane_state->fb->pitches[0] !=3D
plane->state->fb->pitches[0]) rockchip_plane_state->pitch_changed =3D
true). After atomic_check, you should always pass around pointers to
the plane state explicitly, and avoid using the pointers from drm_crtc
and drm_plane.

Does that help?

=46or me, it is more confusing when the display shows something
different to what I have requested. In some media usecases, doing this
is a showstopper and will result in products failing acceptance
testing. Userspace can make a policy decision to try different
alignments to get _something_ to show (even if it's not what was
explicitly requested), but doing this in the kernel is inappropriate:
please just reject it, and have userspace fall back to another
composition method (e.g. GL) in these cases.

Ah yes, you're right. But still, using that would be better than duplic=
ating it.

Of course. You can download Weston from http://wayland.freedesktop.org
- the most interesting dependencies are libevdev, libinput, and
wayland itself. If you are building newer Weston from git, you'll need
the wayland-protocols repository as well, from
anongit.freedesktop.org/git/wayland/wayland-protocols/. Please let me
know privately if you need some more help with building these, but
they should be quite straightforward.

Cheers,
Daniel
