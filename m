SoC vendors in most cases hook ip blocks into their socs in different
and often strange ways. After all it's not some discrete ic you solder
onto a board, but instead a part of the soc itself.

So in most cases you will have some hooks outside the actual gpu iospace
that can be used to tune different things about how the gpu interacts with
the system. Which is probably also the reason the midgard kernel driver
has this ugly "platform" subdirectory for compile-time platform selection.

On my rk3288 for example we have [0] in the chromeos tree, that handles
the oddities of the midgard on the rk3288 used in a lot of Chromebooks.
There are soc-specific oddities of frequencies, frequency-scaling and
whatnot. And there are also more gpu-specific setting in syscon areas
of the soc (pmu and grf) that can also influence the gpus performance
and might need tweaking at some point.

That doesn't even take into account that there may even be differences
on how things are synthesized that we don't know about. See all the
variants of the dw_hdmi ip block (imx, rockchip, meson [more?]) .

So we really want to have the special compatibles in place, to be prepared
for the future per-soc oddities that always appear :-) .
