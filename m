Oh, it looks like you didn't apply Artur's patches, though.
Presumably you applied mine first and they won the race and thus I
guess it's up to Artur to rebase his patches atop mine.  This probably
explains why you told him the patches didn't apply.  I'll reply to
that thread.

...so it turns out that when I try now my patches apply fine [2].  I'm
guessing that you perhaps tried to apply these patches before my
"rk3288's remote wake quirk" which would indeed cause conflicts.  I
mentioned the dependency in my cover letter [1] but totally understand
that it's easy to miss stuff like that.  :-)

I'm going to assume you can just go-ahead and try applying patches 3,
4, and 5 in this series again.  If you want me to repost them then
please let me know.

Thanks, and sorry for the hassle.
