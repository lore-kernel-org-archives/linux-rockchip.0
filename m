Just for context, that function currently is:

void IPAMaliC55::fillParams(unsigned int request,
			    [[maybe_unused]] uint32_t bufferId)
{
	struct mali_c55_params_buffer *params;
	IPAFrameContext &frameContext = context_.frameContexts.get(request);

	params = reinterpret_cast<mali_c55_params_buffer *>(
		buffers_.at(bufferId).planes()[0].data());
	memset(params, 0, sizeof(mali_c55_params_buffer));

	params->version = MALI_C55_PARAM_BUFFER_V1;

	for (auto const &algo : algorithms()) {
		algo->prepare(context_, request, frameContext, params);

		ASSERT(params->total_size <= MALI_C55_PARAMS_MAX_SIZE);
	}

	size_t bytesused = offsetof(struct mali_c55_params_buffer, data) + params->total_size;
	paramsComputed.emit(request, bytesused);
}

Won't buffers_.at(bufferId).planes()[0].size() be the same as 
v4l2_params_buffer_size(MALI_C55_PARAMS_MAX_SIZE)? I am under the impression that that size will 
come ultimately from .queue_setup() which will be setting the sizes with:

sizes[0] = v4l2_params_buffer_size(MALI_C55_PARAMS_MAX_SIZE);

In that sense I suppose that that would remove the need for v4l2_params_buffer_size() to be used in 
userspace and we could just fallback to struct_size_t() within the kernel though.
