Hhm, OK: Without any documentation, I'm seeing "RK3528A" silkscreened
directly on the SoC package :)

Yeah, that's why I started comparing the features - and according to
RK3518's datasheet it only has the features I mentioned in my first mail
for RK3528A minus PCIe and the ability to connect an external ethernet phy
to the gmac controller (it probably has only one). Well, it's version 1.0 of
the datasheet ...
