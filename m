Huh, good find. Seems like something that could go in either the commit
message or the comments.

FWIW, that bug report seems to also be related to the question at hand
-- how to handle L2 link state entry. That bug notes that Linux "doesn't
wait for PME_TO_ACK from the device", but AFAICT, Linux PCI drivers
don't typically send PME_TURN_OFF at all.

So right now, we're just relying on our platform suspend code like this.
It'd be interesting to know if other root complexes had programmable
Message Request support like this available to the host CPU, or if they
all have something hardcoded into their BIOS/ACPI support or something
(or just don't use PME_TURN_OFF at all).

Anyway, I guess that's just a future-work question, in case we want to
consolidate support like this into the PCI core framework.
