I have certainly considered it.

Earlier in this thread Rob nicely proposed a solution to my TFTP.  I
agreed that was a nice solution.  I can certainly use it.  Certainly
there are many places where UUIDs are awesome.  ...but that's still no
reason to assign a random number when a sane and logical numbering
system exists for MMC parts on a given SoC.

Not so much.  I think many people have expressed interest in something
like this.  It seems unlikely to be unique.

Sure.  They don't have the luxury of having a simple and consistent
numbering so they're forced to use UUIDs for booting and have the
extra mental work of mapping IDs to physical hardware.  ...so they're
forced to use UUIDs.

Really I just reposted it several times because I notice that you seem
to ignore many points of my emails.  I was really hoping to get you to
address this point.  I notice that you still didn't.  Either you are
just trying to annoy me, or you don't have an answer to how my patch
series hurts you.

Excellent.  I look forward to your silence.
