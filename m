The problem is that probably all of the above are valid, though maybe
not for all cases. The choice of algorithm probably depends on both the
PWM driver and the consumer, so I don't think fixing things to one such
algorithm is going to improve anything.

I agree.

Perhaps somebody with more experience with pwm-regulator can chime in
here, but it sounds to me like if you really want to accurately output a
voltage, you may want to hand-tune the duty-cycle/period pairs that are
used for pwm-regulator. According to the device tree bindings there's
already support for a voltage table mode where an exact duty-cycle to
output voltage correspondence is defined. This is as opposed to the
continuous voltage mode where the duty cycle is linearly interpolated
based on the requested output voltage.

pwm-regulator in voltage table mode could run in "strict" mode with zero
deviation allowed, on the assumption that duty-cycle values were hand-
picked to give the desired results. For continuous voltage mode it
probably doesn't matter all that much, since very exact results can't be
guaranteed anyway.
