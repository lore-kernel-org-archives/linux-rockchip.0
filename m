why does this need to be a separate rate array and cannot live in the general 
pll rate array?

The plls are general purpose, so we shouldn't limit them arbitarily.

I currently only see some frequencies (594MHz, 297MHz, 54MHz) that are present 
in both arrays but have different settings. As your patch description says 
that these settings reduce clock jitter, wouldn't the general frequencies also 
profit from merging these new values into the general rate array?
