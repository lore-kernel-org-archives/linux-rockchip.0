That would also be a great part of the commit message, like
"...on Gru boards the 32kHz clock gets produced by a Silego oscillator"
or so when you move it over to rk3399-gru.dtsi .

Yep and as I said in my other mail, on these pmic generated clocks
the clock generation often even is configurable (rate, on/off), so it
should really be a real clock not some hack ;-) .
