No. If the w9014 can claim compatibility with then w9013, then you
don't need a kernel change. The DT should list the w9014 AND w9013,
but the kernel only needs to know about the w9013. That is until there
is some difference which is why the DT should list w9014 to start
with.

If you don't have any power control to deal with, then the kernel can
always just match on "hid-over-i2c" compatible.

That is not correct. DT does not abstract the h/w to hide
implementation details like ACPI does with AML code. We still have
specific platform drivers and always will. DT is about removing the
board files and describing connections between devices.
