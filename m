The rockchip io-domain driver currently only depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP
itself. This makes it possible to select the power-domain driver, but
not the POWER_AVS class and results in the iodomain-driver not getting
build in this case.

So add the additional dependency, which also results in the driver
config option now being placed nicely into the AVS submenu.

Kevin wrote when he Acked the patch: "Rafael, feel free to queue this
up as a fix.  I don't have any other drivers/power/avs stuff queued up."

Although I don't know if this is the case anymore.
