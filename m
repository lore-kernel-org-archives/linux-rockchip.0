Thanks, applied for fixes!

I think this is the easiest way to fix the problem for stable and for 4.11.
However I think we should be able to revert this change for 4.12 or
perhaps for 4.13, once we find a more fine-grained solution. As you
probably noticed, I also gave that a try [1]. If you want to test it,
don't forget to revert $subject patch before testing.

Kind regards
Uffe
