And probing drivers under conditions where they may go wrong or deadlock 
is better? I've not yet had a chance to actually test this myself to see 
the effect on timings, but whatever it might be, I can't imagine any 
*other* method of re-serialising child driver probes could be 
significantly better (or if it could be, that might represent some 
improvement we could make to the deferred probe mechanism in general 
anyway).

I have finally got a bit of time this afternoon to pick this up again, 
so I'll have a play and try to finish the write-up capturing all the 
reasoning so far (it's a long one...)

Getting hung up on what phylib does in this one particular case is 
rather missing the point. There is a reason that we're still not forcing 
async_probe on for everything by default. Many drivers will still not 
have been tested and validated to handle it correctly, and while the 
majority of latent issues will likely just be concurrency bugs which can 
be fixed with better locking or whatever, even then we should be 
encouraging developers to actively test and look for such bugs to make 
their drivers "async probe clean", rather than knowingly enabling bugs 
to surface in the wild as weird and subtle breakage on end-user systems.

However, I imagine there will always remain some small minority of 
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS drivers - either for niche legitimate technical 
reasons, or just legacy drivers where updating them would take more 
effort than it's worth - so the driver core surely needs the ability to 
not do the wrong thing itself. That doesn't even need to be "optimal", 
it just needs to be functionally correct.

Thanks,
Robin.
