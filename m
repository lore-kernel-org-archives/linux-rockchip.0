I think the "flat design" is what we have right now. The problem is that the 
core code is pretty similar and only the hardware-specific accesses are 
special, thus the later indirection.

As we don't save to much right now with the currently handled PLLs, I guess 
we could simply only do the first 3 patches and revisit the pll-changes later 
once the next pll-type shows up.
