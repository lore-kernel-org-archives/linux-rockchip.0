We have never specified the device on boards I've worked with.

On rk3288-veyron, for instance, we might have stuffed a Broadcom 4354
WiFi chip or a Marvell 8897 WiFi chip.  Some veyron boards have one
chip and some have the other.  ...and during bringup we even had some
of the exact same boards where half were stuffed with one chip and
half with the other.

Nothing in the device tree says which chip is stuffed.  In both cases
the board uses the same power on sequence for the WiFi chip.  Once
that is done, we dynamically probe which actual WiFi part is stuffed.

Certainly not all users that have these WiFi chips use the same power
on sequence.  I have certainly seen development boards for these chips
where you just insert them into a regular SD card slot.  This is a
more expensive solution because you need more logic on the board, but
it shows that the power on sequence is not associated with these
chips.

It's not always that simple.  The device says that it needs power and
resets to happen.  How power is provided and how resets happen is
awfully board specific.  As per above it is possible that the board
wouldn't need to be involved above is you want to spend more money /
power.
