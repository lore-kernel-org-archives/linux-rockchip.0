Hi Mike, Stephen,

no new clock trees this time, but more clock ids and fixes for issues
present for a longer time (not introduced during the 4.5-rc1 merge wind=
ow)
that Stephen thought should go through the regular process.

Most "interesting" change might be that we now handle factors correctly
according to their position in the clock-tree instead of registering th=
em
individually during init - which became a clutch.

So if nothing stands out, please pull


Thanks
Heiko

  clk: rockchip: convert manually created factor clocks to the new type=
 (2016-02-04 15:54:20 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction of a factor type and a variant containing a gate
to be able to also declare factor clocks in their correct
place in the clock tree instead of having to register factor
clocks in the init callback separately. And as always some more
clock-ids and non-regression fixes for mistakes introduced in
past kernel releases.
