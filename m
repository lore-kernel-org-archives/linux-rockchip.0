Okay, I should not have too much confidence on my TRM maybe :).

Again, We SHOULD refer to the Mobile Storage Host section (Variable
Delay/Clock Generation) instead of CRU section, otherwise even you will
see inconsistent decription of mmc_clock->shift.

NAK my previous comments here. Downside is better for SRD, but won't
work for DDR mode. When running in DDR mode, we should use 90 instead.

So let me elaborate a bit more here.
For DDR mode, one single clk cycle should sending two data bits outside
to the devices. We need a hold time for both. If 180 is used, the first
bit occurs around the downside area, which won't be sampled by devices
on the upside.  So on the upside, the devices will see a zero bit if you
actually send a one-bit, which makes the devices  generate CRC finally.


For this above, 180 for all SDR mode is ok, but 90 should be deployed
for DDR mode. So simply checking the timing to hardcode it should be
fine.
