Let me give a bit of background. The brcmfmac driver implements its own 
runtime-pm like functionality, ie. if the driver is idle for some time 
it will put the device in a low-power state. When it does that it powers 
down several cores in the chip among which the SDIO core. However, the 
SDIO bus used be very bad at handling devices that do that so instead it 
has the Always-On-Station (AOS) block take over the SDIO core in 
handling the bus. Default is will send a R1 response, but only for CMD52 
(and CMD14 but no host is using that cruft). In noCmdDecode it does not 
respond and simply wakes up the SDIO core, which takes over again. 
Because it does not respond timeouts (-110) are kinda expected in this mode.

Arend
