I'd prefer a simple alphabetical sorting.

I think people reading the document will know what device they have, but not 
necessarily the actual soc in it. At least I would look for Google Kevin 
primarily without thinking of the soc at first.

And in general, most Rockchip boards (maybe except Google-boards) tend to 
follow the reference design quite closely, so it may become hard to decide 
when one is similar to another :-) . So best to keep it simple.
