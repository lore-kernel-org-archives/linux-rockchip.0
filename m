Hmm.  I know I got it into the debugger in at least one reboot case
where it was failing to turn the clock off.  I thought I confirmed it
was the core trying to call MMC_POWER_OFF when the power was already
off, but now I'm less certain.  I looked back at my debug session and
I don't see where I got that evidence.  :-/  Certainly if I put a
printout here right now I can't see my code making a difference.

Unfortunately the crash was a very rare one, so I may have to go back
to the drawing board here...
