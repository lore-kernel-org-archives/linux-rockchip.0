Could you please elaborate on this? Do you see MSIs being
allocated but not delivered? Or something else?

The reason I'm asking is that it is very easy to end-up with MSIs
issues with the GICv3 ITS if there is *anything* between the RC and the
ITS. Typically, you'd have an SMMU that could potentially remap PCIe
Requested IDs to Device IDs. Short of describing transformations in the
msi-map property, you could end-up with no MSI being delivered.

Please let me know if I can help.

Thanks,

	M.
