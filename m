pre and post imply a time before and after a certain event, but these
are for 2 different events. These are more like an enable/on delay and
disable/off delay which probably should be separate properties. What
happens when we need the opposite sequence or a different sequence?
Maybe some panel requires the PWM to be 0 until some time after
enabling.

I don't understand why you even need a post delay. The PWM can be set
to 0 while enabled, right? So if the PWM is set to 0 while enabled and
then disable the backlight, then there's no delay. Plus this doesn't
make much sense to me electrically either. The PWM duty cycle is going
to be completely async to the enable line change. The PWM state could
go from 1 to 0 at any point in time relative to the enable line
change.

These issues are the problem with generic bindings. Adding 1 property
is no big deal, but then what happens with the next variation. These
timing constraints need to be able to be implied by the panel's
compatible.
