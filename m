Yes, we can delete the lock here for the same reason as all of the
others that are removed in patch 1.

I don't think it makes much difference whether we use regmap_write or
regmap_update_bits here (although consistently using regmap_update_bits
might be nice) so I won't change it as part of this series, especially
since I don't have an RK2928 to test.
