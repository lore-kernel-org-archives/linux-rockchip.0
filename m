The API stays of course the same, only the degree to settings translati=
on gets=20
optimized, so I guess in the worst case you would get no good phase and=
 thus=20
fall back to non-highspeed modes - but the system would stay running.

But of course, if the clock maintainers could Ack the two clock patches=
 and=20
everything would stay together that would work even better :-)
