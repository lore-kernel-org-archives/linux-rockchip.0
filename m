It's my believe that for MODULE_ALIAS("platform:[...]") to be useful
there needs to be corresponding struct platform_device. For this patch
that would be a platform device named "rockchip-snd-max98090". (This is
something that I try to check rather carefully, because these devices
can be generated on the fly.)

I'm happy to drop this believe if someone shows me another way that
MODULE_ALIAS("platform:[...]") can actually be used.

So, in short, the difference between this driver and other platform
drivers is that, as far as I'm aware, this platform driver lacks a
corresponding platform device. Probably because OF support suffices to
get this module autoloaded.

Thanks,


Paul Bolle
