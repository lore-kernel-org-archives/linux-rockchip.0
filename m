Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: replace gpio-key,wakeup with wakeup-source property

Keyboard driver for GPIO buttons(gpio-keys) checks for the legacy
"gpio-key,wakeup" boolean property to enable gpio buttons as wakeup
source.

Few dts files assign value "1" to gpio-key,wakeup and in one instance a
value "0" is assigned probably assuming it won't be enabled as a wakeup
source. Since the presence of the boolean property indicates it is
enabled, value of "0" have no value.

This patch replaces the legacy "gpio-key,wakeup" with the unified
"wakeup-source" property which inturn fixes the above mentioned issue.

Hi Heiko,

You can reviewed this, however there are couple of ARM64 dts additions.
Also most of the other platform/SoC maintainers preferred to take it via
their tree and few of these got missed during v4.5 merge window.
Can you take it via your tree for v4.6 ?

Regards,
Sudeep
