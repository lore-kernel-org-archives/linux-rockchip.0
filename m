Based on looking at the current code, I believe it just returns 0V
until you call regulator_set_voltage() today.  I don't think that was
always the case.  Back before it was made continuous I think it
returned the voltage that matched with 0% duty cycle.

I haven't dug into what the regulator framework does in the current
system nor what happens if regulator_get_voltage() returns an error.
Perhaps Boris can dig / comment?

I _think_ we're on the same page here.  If there are shortcomings with
the current API that make it impossible to implement a feature, we've
got to change and/or add to the existing API.  ...but we don't want to
break existing users / drivers.

Note that historically I remember that Linus Torvalds has stated that
there is no stable API within the Linux kernel and that forcing the
in-kernel API to never change was bad for software development.  I
tracked down my memory and found
<http://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/lt-binary.html>.  Linus is rabid about not
breaking userspace, but in general there's no strong requirement to
never change the driver API inside the kernel.  That being said,
changing the driver API causes a lot of churn, so presumably changing
it in a backward compatible way (like adding to the API instead of
changing it) will make things happier.

Excellent, so pwm_get_period() gets the period as specified in the
device tree (or other board config) and pwm_get_state() returns the
hardware state.  SGTM.

Sounds fine to me.  PWM regulator is in charge of calling
pwm_get_state(), which can return 0 (or an error?) if driver (or
underlying hardware) doesn't support hardware readout.  PWM regulator
is in charge of using the resulting period / duty cycle to calculate a
percentage.

To answer:

* No, PWM regulator can't guess the correct period.

* PWM regulator API is already fine as is.  Period specified in PWM
specifier and table is specified in percentages.

* Firmware may have voltage setup correctly but may not have the
"ideal" period.  Often firmware configures things in a way that works
but is sub-optimal.  Basically the kernel should be able to tell what
voltage the firmware set things up at (so we know not to go lower on
accident), but we shouldn't assume that the firmware values are
perfect.  Said another way: obviously the firmware made values that
were good enough to boot us to where we are (or we wouldn't be even
executing code), but we might want to configure things to reduce noise
on the lines (make HDMI work better?) or optimize power consumption.

I _think_ the end result of all this is just:

1. Introduce pwm_get_state() that gets hardware state.  Up for debate
if this returns 0 or ERROR if a driver doesn't implement this.

2. PWM regulator calls pwm_get_state at probe time to get hardware
state, calculates a percentage (and voltage) with this.

3. PWM regulator does nothing else until it is asked to set the
voltage, but uses the voltage calculated from #2 to satisfy any "get
voltage" calls.

4. When asked to set the voltage, PWM regulator uses pwm_get_period()
and calculates a duty cycle based on that, just like it does today.
This uses pwm_config() which includes a duty cycle and period and is
thus "atomic".


Said another way: the only action item from this point of view is just
that we introduce a new pwm_get_state().


Boris: I think that's everything you need, right?

--

Historically there was also a necessity that we were very careful with
the PWM clock because the clock would end up getting disabled
temporarily at bootup (after the PWM probe time but before the PWM
regulator finished probing).  Presumably that's either been solved
already or can be debated totally separately.
