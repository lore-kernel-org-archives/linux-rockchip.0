My only concern is that by marking reg-names as required we would break the ABI,
since the RK3588 related changes in the binding (not the DTS ones) got already
released (i.e. since v6.17). That's also the reason we went with this deprecated
order approach.

Nicolas, can you please provide here the statement so that we can agree on the
wording?

Thanks,
