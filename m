It was too late for Marek's patch to go for v4.3 merge window, so I
applied it but not pushed to my for-next branch. AFAIU, Stephen does not
want v4.4 material during merge window because of mangling with statistics.


If you want to rebase (or cherry-pick), you can find Marek's patch here:
branch: defconfig-for-next
repo: git://github.com/krzk/linux.git

However this *branch will be rebased on v4.3-rc1* (because this is
material for v4.4). After v4.3-rc1 I can prepare a tag for other
interested parties.


As for multi_v7_defconfig policy, I got impression from the
Arnd/Olof/Kevin comments on LKML, that platform specific changes should
go through platform tree. However this is multi-platform change so maybe
we can push both patches through arm-soc.


Arnd, Olof, Kevin (BTW, you missed to CC him),

How do you wish to handle this case (USB_DWC2 and two patches: Marek's
and Sjoerd's)?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
