I'm only seeing a cluttered up dts directory with that, as the node
itself is only 9 lines (times 4 devices = 36 lines) and the copyright
header in the dtsi alone is 43 lines ;-) .

With the other includes (analog audio and sdmmc) they really save on
duplicate code, but the sbs node is so tiny and it looks like the arm32
dts directory will stay in that format for the forseeable future, that I'd
somehow prefer the sbs to move into the affected devices directly.
