Ah, I was wrongly assuming that the kernel didn't have enough
information to make an informed decision in this case, sorry.

Guess the per-user rate limits don't help here because the consumer
with higher priority could work with frequencies other than the ideal.

And we cannot have a consumer listening for PRE_RATE_CHANGE and
aborting unwanted changes or rerouting the ancestors of the clocks of
other consumers because that would be a massive violation of
separation of concerns.

If we were to rearrange the clock topology from within the CCF, then
consumers need to have a way to communicate to the core that they are
more important than other consumers. clk_set_important(clk, true)
could be enough in this case, but would be insufficient in more
complex cases where more than two clocks could use the same PLL.

If we don't actually need input from userspace for this use case, I
wouldn't go this way right now, because it seems to me like it could
be a really big timesink for little gain.

Once someone comes with a situation in which feedback from userspace
is really needed, that person can propose such an interface ;)
