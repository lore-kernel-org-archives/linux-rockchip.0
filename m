I would suggest s/pin number/bit number in the associated GRF register/ 
here. At least in this RK3328 case there's only one pin, which isn't 
numbered, and if you naively considered it pin 0 of this 'bank' you'd 
already have the wrong number. Since we're dealing with the "random 
SoC-specific controls" region of the GRF as opposed to the 
relatively-consistent and organised pinmux parts, I don't think we 
should rely on any assumptions about how things are laid out.

I was initially going to suggest a more specific compatible string as 
well, but on reflection I think the generic "rockchip,gpio-syscon" for 
basic "flip this single GRF bit" functionality actually is the right way 
to go. In the specific RK3328 GPIO_MUTE case, there look to be 4 bits in 
total related to this pin - the enable, value, and some pull controls 
(which I assume apply when the output is disabled) - if at some point in 
future we *did* want to start explicitly controlling the rest of them 
too, then would be a good time to define a separate 
"rockchip,rk3328-gpio-mute" binding (and probably a dedicated driver) 
for that specialised functionality, independently of this basic one.

data->dat_bit_offset is always 0 here, but given that wrapping large 
offsets to successive GRF registers doesn't make sense (and wouldn't 
work anyway with this arithmetic) I don't think you even need this 
calculation of offs at all...

... since it would suffice to use offset here...
