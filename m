I tested these patches. Because our kernel is based on v4.4, so I back
port most changes about
include/linux/irqdomain.h
kernel/irq/irqdomain.c
drivers/irqchip/irq-gic-v3.c
and change rk3399.dtsi base on your arm,gic-v3.txt:

     gic: interrupt-controller@fee00000 {
         compatible =3D "arm,gic-v3";
-        #interrupt-cells =3D <3>;
+        #interrupt-cells =3D <4>;
         #address-cells =3D <2>;
         #size-cells =3D <2>;
=2E..
+
+        ppi-partitions {
+            part0: interrupt-partition-0 {
+                affinity =3D <&cpu_l0 &cpu_l1 &cpu_l2 &cpu_l3>;
+            };
+
+            part1: interrupt-partition-1 {
+                affinity =3D <&cpu_b0 &cpu_b1>;
+            };
+        };

and change every interrupts from three cells to four cells, such as
     saradc: saradc@ff100000 {
         compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-saradc";
         reg =3D <0x0 0xff100000 0x0 0x100>;
-        interrupts =3D <GIC_SPI 62 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+        interrupts =3D <GIC_SPI 62 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0>;
         #io-channel-cells =3D <1>;
         clocks =3D <&cru SCLK_SARADC>, <&cru PCLK_SARADC>;
         clock-names =3D "saradc", "apb_pclk";

and pmu define as:
    pmu_a53 {
        compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a53-pmu";
        interrupts =3D <GIC_PPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW &part0>;
        interrupt-affinity =3D <&cpu_l0>,
                     <&cpu_l1>,
                     <&cpu_l2>,
                     <&cpu_l3>;
    };

    pmu_a72 {
        compatible =3D "arm,cortex-a72-pmu", "arm,cortex-a57-pmu";
        interrupts =3D <GIC_PPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW &part1>;
        interrupt-affinity =3D <&cpu_b0>,
                     <&cpu_b1>;
    };

It can boot. And I test with Android simpleperf stat and perf top, it w=
orks!
So these patches work on RK3399.

But as I mentioned, we must change every interrupt in dts, do you think
this is acceptable?

I don't change drivers/perf/arm_pmu.c, it just work.
