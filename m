Whenever controller need to communicate with card, must init/power_on 
phy firstly.

Theoretically, it is.  Although my soc don't use phy for removable card, 
I also consider how to handle this case. Should we add a hook
for sdhci_get_cd, and initialize phy if it's non-removeable device or 
removeable card in slot ? Doesn't seem like a good idea.

Also seems not always work if we just use SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE to detect 
card insertion/removal without phy in active state.

yes, we can power off it in runtime suspend. So we can append some 
patches later to introduce runtime pm for sdhci-of-arasan?
