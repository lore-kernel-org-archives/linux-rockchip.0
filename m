I agree, I saw this in the driver. This is the way I put the 0xffff
period in the patch 7 of this series. I though that since all the drivers
which uses PWM framework uses the generic PWM bindings (except pwm-pxa.c,
pwm-cros-ec.c and pwm-clps711x.c) I though it would be simpler (from the
driver's perspective and also from core's perspective) to have generic
bindings for all as follows:
pwms = <&controller PWM-channel PWM-period PWM-flags>;

To allow pwm-cross-ec.c to use this generic binding, since it is uses a
fix period and of_pwm_xlate() xlate DT arguments without taking care of
the cross-ec particularity, using 0xffff period in the pwms binding will
not harm this driver (correct me if I'm wrong). For this, the pwm-cells
argument need to be increased at 2. In patch 7 of this series I used
pwms = <&cros_ec_pwm 1 65535>;
which initialize the PWM 1 with 0xffff period.

Thanks,
Claudiu
