I'd like to disagree here :-)

Generic is actually currently "rockchip-usb-phy", the platform-driver name, 
but thankfully that hasn't leaked into the dts, as even that name + filename 
should change in the future. What rk3288 (and before) uses is a Designware 
picophy with custom registers in the grf, so it should actually be
"rockchip-usb-picophy" or so. Following socs use a different IP (Innosilicon 
if I remember correctly), with different clock/pll handling and a whole 
different set of registers, so will get a new driver.

In terms of hardware compatibility, the phys aren't actually compatible, it's 
only per chance that the used SIDDQ bit has the same position on all socs :-)
Everything else seems to move around quite happily in the registers.


As it stands now, the rk3188 dts has a compatible of 
"rockchip,rk3188-usb-phy", "rockchip,rk3288-usb-phy", matching the usable 
[refraining from calling it generic] driver on old kernels, while now it is 
supposed to match the actually correct rk3188 variant. So that combination 
works with the same dts on both old and new kernels fullfilling the ABI-
stability promise.

With the new matching code (clock-names etc) you actually get issues if you 
try to match against "rockchip,rk3288-usb-phy" on a rk3188, so there is no 
"generic" part. And that difference will widen if we need to control other 
parts of the usb-phy as well.

So essentially that second property should go completely, I just didn't wanted 
to create the impression of changing the ABI here ;-)


Sorry for that wall of text.
