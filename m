I don't know detail of HDMI audio of RK3328, but maybe it has cpu or 
codec DAIs. The audio-graph-card is supporting to use multiple DAIs on
a card. This is same as simple-audio-card.

For example, add I2S0 device as hw:X,0
(and move SPDIF to hw:X,0 -> hw:X,1)

sound {
	compatible = "audio-graph-card";
	label = "rockchip,rk3328";
	dais = <&i2s0_p0
		&spdif_p0>;
};

&i2s0 {
	status = "okay";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;

	i2s0_p0: port {
		i2s0_p0_0: endpoint {
			dai-format = "i2s";
			remote-endpoint = <&some_codec_abcd>;
		};
	};
};

We should write special card driver for RK3328 sound if audio-graph-card
is not enough to deal with HDMI audio.

I think multiple DAIs on single card and single DAI on multiple cards
are both OK to work. But I cannot decide the way for this issue.
