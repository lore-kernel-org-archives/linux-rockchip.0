Thanks for going into so much detail, this helps a lot in understanding

That really depends on the use-case. If you're interested in the output
power of the PWM then, yes, this is sane. But it might not be the right
answer in other cases.

But then you get into a situation where behaviour is dependent on the
PWM driver, whereas this is really very specific to one specific use-
case.

In the end the PWM API is as low-level as it is because it needs to be
flexible enough to cope with other use-cases. In the general case the
simple truth is that it doesn't make sense to set a period without the
duty cycle and vice versa. That's why pwm_config() takes both as input
parameters. The atomic API is going to take that one step further in
that you need to specify the complete state of the PWM when applying.

Yes and no. I think the PWM regulator would need to get the current
hardware state and derive the output power from duty cycle and period.
It would then need to rescale to whatever new period it wants to use
to ensure the same output power is used.

I'm not aware of any code in the PWM subsystem that would do this
automatically. If you don't call any of the pwm_*() functions the
hardware state should not be modified. The responsibility is with
the user drivers.

That is, it is up to the regulator or backlight driver to apply any new
configuration to a PWM channel on boot, or leave it as is. For
backlight it's probably fine to simply apply some default, since having
the brightness change on boot isn't going to be terribly irritating.

With the atomic API it would be possible to avoid even this and have the
backlight driver simply read out the current hardware state and apply an
equivalent brightness even if the period changed.

For the regulator case you'd need to read out the current state and then
recompute the values that will yield the same output power given data
specified in DT. I think that much is already implemented in Boris'
series, and it's really only the details that are being debated.

The problematic issue is still that we might have a disparity between
the current hardware state and the state initially specified by DT. In
the general case the DT will specify the period and polarity of the PWM
signal and leave it up to the user driver to determine what a correct
duty cycle would be. With the atomic API we'll essentially have two
states: the current (hardware) state and the "initial" state, which is
what an OS will see as the state to apply. The problem now is that once
you have applied the initial state with a duty cycle you've determined,
there is no longer a need to keep it around. But there's also no way to
know when this is the case. So the controversial part about all this is
when to start using the current state rather that the initial state.

The most straightforward way to solve this would be to apply the initial
configuration on driver probe. That is, when the pwm-regulator driver
gets probed it would retrieve the current and initial states, then
adjust the current state such that it matches the initial state but with
a duty cycle that yields the same output power as the current state, and
finally apply the new state. After that, every regulator_set_voltage()
call could simply operate on the current state and adjust the duty cycle
exclusively.

Does that sound reasonable?
