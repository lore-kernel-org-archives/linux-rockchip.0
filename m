The problem is still the same as always. These clocks may or may not be 
present, a lot of them come from IP blocks that probe later than the clock 
controller and create a circular dependency.

I.e. the usbphy IP block gets supplied with a clock from the CRU that it needs 
to function at all, but also contains a PLL on that clock that gets fed back 
into the CRU to supply other clocks. Same for the other external clocks.

So we cannot "get" (and verify) these clocks when the core clock init runs
Therefore we're relying on the ability of the clock-framework to complete the 
clock-tree once these clocks become available (or drop them again, if they 
disappear again)
