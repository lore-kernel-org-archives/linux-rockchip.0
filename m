In these cases I would expect the WIFI driver to deal with the SDIO
IRQ itself and not requesting it via calling sdio_claim_irq(). Because
of this, there should be no polling performed by the sdio_irq_thread.

No, that seems like a bad idea. I think it would rather add overhead -
decreasing performance. Likely it will also make us wake up the mmc
host from its low power state, when when it actually isn't needed.

Kind regards
