For the series:

Acked-by: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>

It's easier if everything goes via Rafael's PM tree. Moreover, this
series is to me rather trivial, so I would actually recommend to pick
it all for 4.15. Mainly because, moving too slowly forward, allows new
users to show up of the callback you remove in patch5.

Kind regards
