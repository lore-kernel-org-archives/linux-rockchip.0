Thank you for your kindness reviewing this. I am not an experienced
Linux kernel contributor so I am going to do some mistakes during this
process.

We usually follow the required feature set listed on Gentoo wiki[1] as
it is usually up to date and avoids a lot of headaches for us when
dealing with boot issues with SystemD.

Do you think mentioning where it has been taken from is enough?

I can certainly improve it for the next submission. Should I split
them all and tag them v2 to easy it?
