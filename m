You're the boss here, but that's not how I envisioned it if I ever
found time to dig deeper.

My vision of the world is probably colored by the dw_mmc IP block,
though.  Both of the two SoC families that I've dealt with that have
dw_mmc (both Exynos and Rockchip) have always had a pin that could be
muxed as "SDIO Interrupt".  If you choose this pinmux, my
understanding is that it will assert the dw_mmc's normal SDIO
interrupt in the IP block.  The DesignWare datasheet talks about this
in terms of eSDIO.  It does talk a little bit about the fact that this
method of interrupting can happen even when the card clock is off.

Given that this concept seems generic, is directly supported by the
dw_mmc hardware, and is talked about in the dw_mmc datasheet, it seems
as if dw_mmc would be the place to deal with it.

If other controllers don't support this concept in a generic way, I
see no reason why we still couldn't handle it in a generic way (via a
GPIO) at the mmc level rather than forcing each WiFi driver to invent
this themselves.

...but obviously I haven't worked through all the details and have
never actually coded this up successfully.

Sounds like Shawn is using an out-of-tree driver, but if it's anything
like the in-tree driver then there's no Runtime PM anyway.  See the
pm_runtime_forbid() in brcmf_sdiod_probe().
