Hi guys,

if i'm reading the code right, the PM clk means:
1/ the clocks which would be enabled while power on
2/ these clocks are optional, it's ok if anything wrong with them
3/ controlled by pm_domain(or USE_PM_CLK_RUNTIME_OPS & pm_clk_add_notifier)

and currently we're adding all clocks of the attached device as PM clk 
in rockchip PM domain driver, which seems wrong. because we might have 
these kinds of clocks:
1/ critical, should block power on if anything wrong with it(failed to 
get/ prepare/ enable)
2/ optional, could ignore it if anything wrong
3/ only required in some special cases, for example register r/w, and 
doesn't need to stay enabled while power on

so maybe we can:
1/ let the device(dts) or driver decide which clock is PM clk, and add 
it using *pm_clk_add* APIs (even of_pm_clk_add_clks() if all clocks are 
pm clk)

2/ add support for critical PM clk, which would return error to the 
driver if anything wrong

3/ make sure PM clk always be controlled(otherwise it might be 
unexpected disabled by other clocks under the same clk parent?):
  a) make sure Runtime PM is always enabled. and as discussed, we can 
select PM in ARCH_ROCKCHIP

  b) make sure the device has a PM domain to control PM clk:
select ROCKCHIP_PM_DOMAINS for ARCH_ROCKCHIP(that would also select 
PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS)

check dev->pm_domain before hand over PM clk, since we only care about 
EPROBE_DEFER when attach PM domain:
         ret = dev_pm_domain_attach(_dev, true);
         if (ret != -EPROBE_DEFER) {
                 if (drv->probe) {
                         ret = drv->probe(dev);

or

  c) make pm_clk_suspend/pm_clk_resume part of the generic PM Runtime 
flow(even without a PM domain)
