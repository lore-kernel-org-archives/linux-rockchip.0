I guess the easiest way would be taking the of_usb_get_dr_mode_by_phy()
function move the part above the "finish" label into a separate function
like of_usb_get_node_by_phy (or possibly move that to an even more general
place as it is not usb-related at all) and use that function in
of_usb_get_dr_mode_by_phy() and also use it to get the reset you want via
something like:

node = of_usb_get_node_by_phy(...);
rst = of_reset_control_get(node, ...);

Did you find any different solution for that yet?
