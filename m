There is no indication in the iMX6 manuals that the iMX6 supports
automatic CTS calculation.  Bits 7:4 of the AUD_CTS3 register are
marked as "reserved".

We're reliant on the information in the iMX6 manuals as we don't have
access to Synopsis' databooks for these parts (I understand you have
to be a customer to have access to that.)
