However earlier the call wasn't done at all, and that didn't cause
problems.

I don't have any background here. My initial assumption would be that
it should be enough to re-configure them when the frequency passes the
threshold in either direction.

Anyway, IIUC there shouldn't be more than 5 frequency changes per
second (polling_ms = 200), and likely no all of them would pass the
threshold, so it seems limiting the calls (if possible) would be a
micro-optimization and is probably not worth the hassle :)

Thanks
