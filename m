While the opp bindings documentation doesn't mention anything
about operating-points being deprecated, the code and comments in
of.c are pretty clear about this:

	/*
	 * OPPs have two version of bindings now. The older one is deprecated,
	 * try for the new binding first.
	 */

So I shall use operating-points-v2 in my patch v4.

Thanks,
Guillaume
