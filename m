Ok, blame me, so the reason I saw that message often is because my DT
missed the entries to define the reset (fixed in the latest series I
sent) So completely my fault.

Doing your bind/unbind stress test with mainline I'm getting some
errors though, the 'phy poweron failed --> -110' disapeared and your
patch helps.

But sometimes I get :

And after some minutes of test I get a:

So there is still something wrong with current mainline that seems
it's solved in chromeos. I'll try to investigate a bit.
