This is really nice to see interest in enabling encoder for this chips set.=
 I'm
adding Detlev in CC here, as he's actively working on RK3588 encoder, which=
 is
quite a similar chip. But there is quite a twist his approach which I'll ex=
plain
shortly.

What I believe I've seen walking through your RFC is an encoder based on V4=
L2
Stateful encoder interface:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-encoder.=
html

While this isn't invalid, specially for encoders, for this type of hardware=
, the
community agreed direction was to introduce V4L2 Stateless Encoder
specification, using the media request and compound controls to maintain a =
lower
level interface for this HW. See Paul's proposal for IMX8MP Hantro VC8000E =
chips
(H.264 only for now):

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260522101653.2565125-1-paulk@sys-base.io/

The downside is that we need a new spec document for this class of driver t=
o
reach upstream (not part of Paul's series). Plus, for each codec, appropria=
te
encode parameter controls needs to be designed, and they must be proven to =
work
across multiple hardware (generally at least 2). I still think there is a n=
eed
for V4L2 drivers like this. Being high level, they offer a great interface =
to
protect against HW actions that would be harmful to the Linux operating sys=
tem.
Specially when you don't have an IOMMU like the IMX8M Plus. But at the same
time, V4L2 memory model often clash with modern graphic stack, making the
integration quite painful.

Here's the twist to Detlev (and myself) approach. In order to make the kern=
el
module even thinner, and to avoid having to specify new V4L2 interfaces, we
decided to look into making drivers similar to how we do GPU drivers today.=
 This
is possible today thanks to the Vulkan Video standard. So Detlev driver, wh=
ich
finally got P-Frames support few days ago (he'll explain why this didn't wo=
rk
initially for him), is split in two part:

- The kernel module, which expose hardware specific interface (he decided t=
o
implement it in Rust)
- The userspace driver, which he's implementing in Mesa project

What I really like of this approach is that the kernel driver is much more
stable, as it expose the HW at a lower level in a codec agnostic way. For t=
he
final application, the interface is the same regardless if its a GPU attach=
ed
codec or a standalone codec. Its even the same interface if you are on Wind=
ows,
except for the low level zero-copy interop. The rest of the development can
happen in userspace, which is a lot faster to develop and easier to debug.

One thing we notice, is that for performance reason, keeping rate control a=
s
close to the IRQ as possible is important. Its impossible to batch any work=
 if
you have to constantly wait for the previous work to be done in order to co=
mpute
the next set of QP values. For that reason, we plan to eventually share the=
se
in-kernel implementation with V4L2. In our imagination, eBPF could also be =
a
usable option.

I will leave to Detlev to share some early code once he's ready, but consid=
ering
you both are working on the same family of encoder, it would certainly be a=
 lot
nicer if both endup with the same type of drivers. Offering two interface f=
or
the same hardware would impose a lot of extra effort that I would rather av=
oid.

regards,
Nicolas
