No, it works fine. But I am going to guess
(1) is there any code or user-space binary care about the domain
numbers, so it will complain about this?
(2) if there are two doamins for PCI hierarchy, so when I unbind
and bind one of them continuously, is it possible that finally they
will share the same domain number as the domain number would be
overflow ? But actually they didn't share the same domain. :)

I just thought we should fix the domain number here by adding
"linux,pci-domain = <0>" for rk3399.dtsi, which seems more wise
to me now. Does it make sense to you?
