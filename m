Did this problem ever get resolved? To be clear, I believe the problem
at hand is:

(a) in suspend/resume (not runtime PM; we may not even have runtime PM
support for most PCI devices)
(b) using a level-triggered signal (PCI WAKE# is active low, and it's
nice to avoid certain races by treating it as level-triggered)

And with the current wakeirq code (and the latest version of Jeffy's
patch series, IIUC), I believe the above case can still trigger an
interrupt storm of sorts (it's not usually unrecoverably-stormy, since
it's a threaded IRQ, and we make "enough" progress).

I don't see how "ordering" can really resolve this problem, unless the
ordering is configured such that the interrupt handler never runs (e.g.,
we disable the IRQ before we get out of any "noirq" phase).

Options I can think of:
(1) implement runtime PM callbacks for all PCI devices, where we clear
any PME status and ensure WAKE# stops asserting [1]
(2) synchronize a device's resume() with the dedicated wake IRQ
(3) skip using the dedicated wake IRQ infrastructure and write our own
interrupt handler for this PCI/PM function

Option (1) seems pretty strange; we don't actually want to manage these
devices with runtime PM.

Option (2) could work, but it would probably require sharing more of the
core suspend/resume internals between
drivers/base/power/{wakeirq,main}.c, which may not be desirable. Among
other problems, that seems more fragile.

Option (3) is easy enough, and we already did that once for the first
pass at poorly implementing this WAKE# logic within the mwifiex driver
:)

I don't see how that would be good enough. You still have a window of
time while the driver hasn't finished resuming, in which the interrupt
handler might trigger many times.

[1] Then we also need to fixup handle_threaded_wake_irq(). Currently it
will not even try to resume the device:

	/* Maybe abort suspend? */
	if (irqd_is_wakeup_set(irq_get_irq_data(irq))) {
		pm_wakeup_event(wirq->dev, 0);

		return IRQ_HANDLED; <--- we exit here
	}

	/* We don't want RPM_ASYNC or RPM_NOWAIT here */
	res = pm_runtime_resume(wirq->dev);
	...
