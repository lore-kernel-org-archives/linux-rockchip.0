I seem to remember Heiko requesting something be added to the commit
message.  Ah yes, he said:

Presumably Heiko could add that to the commit message when he applies
the patch, so maybe wait to see if he wants you to respin it?

Really this should be below the power tree, AKA right above
"gpio-keys".  Convention has typically been that only "special" nodes
like "chosen" go all the way at the top here.  Then the power tree
(parents first), then other nodes.

In the Chrome OS tree we had an "/* END REGULATORS */ comment to try
to separate out the power tree from the rest of the nodes, but I guess
Heiko didn't like that when this went upstream so now you just have to
know the convention.  :-P

Possibly Heiko would re-sort this for you himself when applying the
change if he agrees with my understanding of the conventions.

Other than my nits:
