This change would introduce such a dependency where it was not there
before, so this could introduce a regression.

I've identified ~40 Rockchip based boards where there is a dependency on
the bootloader due to using that generic compatible. Some from the start
and some got it added with a similar conversion as I proposed above.
I haven't seen massive bug reports, so it looks like it's currently ok.
I don't like having such a dependency and certainly not adding one where
it previously was not the case.

In other cases, the generic compatible was replaced with a specific one
for the PHY being used, which 'circumvents' the raised concern:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20260202-px30-eth-phy-v1-0-ef365be64922@cherry.de/

According to the FriendlyELEC schematics I checked, they seem to use the
RTL8211F a LOT. On the NanoPi R6* they use a/the specific compatible:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v7.0/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3588s-nanopi-r6.dtsi#L348

I've sent FriendlyELEC an email to ask whether they ONLY used that PHY
in the R5S (LTS) in which case it is safe to replace the generic
compatible with the specific one. I haven't received a response yet.

I prefer that there's first an agreed upon 'strategy' on how to deal 
with the above mentioned raised concern so that it can be implemented
consistently.
