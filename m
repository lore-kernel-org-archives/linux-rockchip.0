Ohh, there are already mmc drivers dealing with phys. We can add this
for you driver as well.

Regarding corecfg_*, unless that also can be managed via a generic
interface (perhaps through syscon), then you need to manage that via
genpd. Is that the case?

Yes, that's a common scenario, many device drivers do this - as to
avoid wasting power.

Latency constraints may be controlled via the genpd governor.

Moreover we also have the runtime PM autosuspend feature, which is
useful when you don't wont to runtime suspend the device between each
and every request. Thus avoiding latencies when there are a "burst" of
requests.

Hmm, I just want to make sure we do the right things. Else it might
just bite us in the other end.

Again, my recommendation is to start with runtime PM then continue
with system PM. I can imagine you will get system PM "free" if using
the runtime PM centric approach.

Kind regards
