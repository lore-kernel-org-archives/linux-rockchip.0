NO_IRQ being -1 is a legacy thing for ARM - all ARM drivers are supposed
to be converted to use <= 0 or == 0 to detect invalid IRQs, and _eventually_
once all users are gone, NO_IRQ deleted.

Moreover, there are supposed to be no _new_ users of NO_IRQ ever added to
the kernel.

Modern drivers should _all_ be using !irq to detect invalid IRQs, and not
using NO_IRQ.

The steps here are:

1. Convert all ARM platforms to start numbering IRQs from 1 rather than 0.
2. Convert all drivers used on ARM to detect lack of IRQ by checking for
   <= 0.
3. Replace NO_IRQ assignments with zero-initialisations.
4. Remove NO_IRQ.

The reason it hasn't happened is that it requires effort and testing,
and rather than running around getting old platforms to boot (which
includes remembering _how_ to get them to boot) with recent kernels,
I prefer to spend my time doing more productive work with modern code.
