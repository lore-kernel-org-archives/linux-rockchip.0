Yes, I noticed that and this is what puzzles me a bit.

Well, it depends if the genpd has a subdomain or other devices in it
being runtime resumed.
The genpd will not power off unless all devices within it are runtime
enabled+suspended and that its subdomains are also powered off.

So, in case you only have one device and no subdomains, then your
statement is correct.

I guess you mean runtime PM autosuspend? Then why don't you support this?

Wouldn't that allow you to avoid wasting power in runtime when the
device is idle?

I am not sure I follow you here. You must not rely on that the device
always becomes runtime suspended during system suspend, as there are
no guarantees for this.

Instead that is something you need to take care of in the
subsystem/driver for the device, of course.

Yes!

Using genpd without deploying runtime PM for the devices doesn't make
much sense, at least to me.

No worries. I understand this might be a bit tricky, that's why I also
tries to help review related changes.

Kind regards
