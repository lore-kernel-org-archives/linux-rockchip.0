Side note: I think Doug mentioned previously that the default
rk3399.dtsi actually leaves the default clock choice (i.e., case 2), so
it might be good to patch this property into the rk3399.dtsi instead of
the board files. If any board goes with option 1, they can delete the
property.

I can patch this up myself if you don't, as I'm working on upstreaming
the rk3399-gbased Gru/Kevin device trees.
