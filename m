Okay, after reading again your first answer, I think I understand why
you want to differentiate the when-disabled and when-input cases. You
want to use the "init" and "default" pinctrl states. The "init" state
(applied at probe time) would keep the PWM pin in gpio+input mode and
the "default" state (applied when the PWM device is enabled for the
first time) would mux the pin to the PWM device.
Your solution requires that the pwm-regulator device knows in which
state the pin attached to the PWM is, which IMO is breaking the
layering we have right now: a PWM-regulator is assigned a PWM device
which is assigned a pin and a pinmux config.
Another solution would be to expose an additional information in the
pwm_state: whether the PWM is in the INIT state (probed, but not yet
configured by its user) or DEFAULT state (probed and already
configured by its user). But again, by doing that we also expose
internal PWM details to its user, which I'm not sure will help keep
the PWM API simple.

Actually, I had something slightly different in mind. I thought about
having two new pinctrl states ("enabled" and "disabled"). The "enabled"
state (pin muxed to the PWM device) would be applied each time the PWM
is enabled, and "disabled" state (gpio+input mode) would be applied each
time the PWM is disabled.
This way we can guarantee that even when the PWM is disabled, the
PWM-driven regulator is configured to output a non-destructive voltage.
Hence my suggestion to name the property 'voltage-when-pwm-disabled'.
