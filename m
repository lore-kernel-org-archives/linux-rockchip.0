As far as I can tell/remember rev10 was originally created to support
making a SKU of jerry that had a different LCD.  rev11-rev15 were
added to give some wiggle room for future builds.  Downstream has a
separate device tree for rev10-rev15 (compared to rev3-rev7) with the
expectation that differences relating to the LCD would be accounted
for there but nothing was ever added to the rev10-rev15 making it
identical to the rev3-rev7 one.

It's likely nothing actually shipped with rev10-rev15 but they are
listed in the downstream kernel's device tree and it seems like it
should add a little safety if we match them here just in case
something actually shipped with one of these revisions and that device
will break if we don't claim support.
