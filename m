This adds the 32k clock to the RK3399 Gru board file. Even though it's
not directly used, muxes will end up traversing the entire clk tree on
calls to determine_rate if it doesn't exist. This is because the 32k
clk is listed as a possible parent on some clks. Since the clk doesn't
know about the 32k clk (it was never registered), it triggers a global
search for it. This can happen about 40 times per second, which isn't
great for power.
