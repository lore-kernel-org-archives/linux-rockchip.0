Yes, except it would be the property name. The driver could either
iterate over the properties of the reboot-mode node or lookup the
property when it has the reboot reason string. We generally like to
parse everything up front at probe, but the latter would be somewhat
easier to implement. Perhaps we would want to prefix nodes with
"mode-" or something.

Vendors can certainly still add their own (e.g.
vendor,halt-and-catch-fire = <0xdead>).

The question here really is will we ever need additional data for each
mode (in the DT) besides "magic". We can do some amount of extending
the property like allowing more that single 32-bit value. We can't mix
strings and integers though. If we don't need that, then lets go with
the more concise approach. This isn't really an evolving area.
Selecting boot mode/device has existed for a long time on PCs (it is
fixed list in the IPMI spec for example). So I can't imagine that we'd
have to extend this, but I'd like to hear thoughts on it. You had
mentioned the Galaxy Nexus having a value and a string, but I'd find
it surprising if the bootloader actually uses the string.

Either way they need to document it. It's either a new linux,mode
value or a new property name. Vendors are free to add whatever they
want, but for upstream it has to go thru review.
