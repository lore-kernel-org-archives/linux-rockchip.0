This was probably my fault.  I did some searching and found
<https://arasan.com/wp-content/media/eMMC-5-1-Total-Solution_Rev-1-3.pdf>.
It appears to be docs for a similar (but not identical) PHY.  We were
looking at it to try to get more clarity on some bits that were hard
to understand in the docs we had.

In that doc there appear to be 3 bits for selecting the DLL operation
and they have ranges defined.  In Rockchip's PHY there are only 2
bits.  Thus things don't map totally properly.

Anyway, comment should probably be removed.


I _think_ that this just needs to match the input clock rate of the
eMMC, right?  So presumably the PHY should get a reference to the same
clock that was given to the controller clock.  It can check the clock
at probe time and then register a notifier to keep the in sync (if we
expect the clock to change).

IMHO adding all of that complexity seems like it could wait for a
followup patch.  For now we can assume 200 MHz I think?

Starting out with something sane like 50 ohms seems like it makes
sense for now.  It's OK to start with a default for now to get things
basically working and then add device tree support once we have a
second user.


When we're ready to make this more generic, IMHO we might consider
having the PHY implement the pinctrl API and officially be a pin
controller and we use those bindings.  We are controlling pins so
using the pinctrl API seems like it might make sense?

I _think_ that perhaps what we're specifying here is actually slew
rate, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  It looks as if "drive
strength" is supposed to be specified in terms of mA and the docs I
find show that we're actually controlling how fast the pins will
toggle.

I'm not 100% certain I know how the pinctrl bindings apply in this
case (maybe Heiko has ideas, or maybe we should send a proposal to
Linus W?), but from the bindings they look like they offer some
flexibility.

Maybe this would look like below (or maybe you need some extra sub-nodes)

       sdhci: sdhci@fe330000 {
               compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-sdhci-5.1", "arasan,sdhci-5.1";
               reg = <0x0 0xfe330000 0x0 0x10000>;
               interrupts = <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
               clocks = <&cru SCLK_EMMC>, <&cru ACLK_EMMC>;
               clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
               assigned-clocks = <&cru SCLK_EMMC>;
               assigned-clock-rates = <200000000>;
               phys = <&emmc_phy>;
               phy-names = "phy_arasan";
               pinctrl-names = "default";
               pinctrl-0 = <&pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x1_00>;
               status = "disabled";
       };

               emmc_phy: phy@f780 {
                       compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-emmc-phy";
                       reg = <0xf780 0x20>;
                       #phy-cells = <0>;
                       status = "disabled";

                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x1_00: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x1-00 {
                               slew-rate = <100>;
                       };
                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x1_50: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x1-50 {
                               slew-rate = <150>;
                       };
                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x0_75: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x0-75 {
                               slew-rate = <75>;
                       };
                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x0_50: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x0-50 {
                               slew-rate = <50>;
                       };
                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x1_20: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x1-20 {
                               slew-rate = <120>;
                       };
                       pcfg_emmc_slew_rate_x1_20: pcfg-emmc-slew-rate-x1-20 {
                               slew-rate = <120>;
                       };
           };

The nice thing about using the pinctrl API is that:

* It allows us to _also_ control pullups / pulldowns.  We probably
want to control those also since some boards may use external pullups
and others may want to use the internal ones.

* If SDHCI needs to dynamically adjust things (like turning on pulls,
adjusting drive strengths, etc) it can do it in a sane API.

Sounds like this should be handled as per above: make sure that the
PHY has access to the clock and can check it's rate.

---

So overall:

* Should re-spin and remove the comment about 170 MHz.

* I think this could land as-is other than the comment.

* Long term someone (hopefully at Rockchip) should think about making
the driver auto-adjust using the clock API.

* Long term someone (hopefully at Rockchip) should think about trying
to use the pinctrl API to allow adjusting drive strengths and pullups.
