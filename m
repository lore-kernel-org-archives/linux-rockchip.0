Hi Mark,

Forgot to follow up here:

I haven't personally verified this behavior (it probably wouldn't be too
hard to rig up a test driver to hold CS low while allowing the
controller to autosuspend? spidev can do this?), but Rockchip folks seem
to have concluded this.

I suppose I'm fine with relying on cs-gpios as a workaround.
