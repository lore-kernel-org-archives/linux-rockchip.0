Well, the specific issue is certainly unique to serial.
But what I was suggesting is that 5 years from now, these patches
could be the "legacy reasons" in mmc.

FWIW, there is already a defacto expectation by boot configurations in the
field that a given mmc block device is stable across boots. The reality
is that 100000's of kernel command lines look like:

	root=/dev/mmcblk0p2

This was a recent regression fixed by Ulf in commit 9aaf3437aa72
("mmc: block: Use the mmc host device index as the mmcblk device index")

SCSI does. Here's what Linus said:

"So the *simple* model is to just scan the devices minimally serially,
and allocate the names at that point (so the names are reliable
between boots for the same hardware configuration). And then do the
more expensive device setup asynchronously (ie querying device
information, spinning up disks, whatever - things that can take
anything from milliseonds to several seconds, because they are doing
actual IO). So you'd do some very basic (and _often_ fairly quick)
operations serially, but then try to do the expensive parts
concurrently.

The SCSI layer actually goes a bit further than that: it has a fairly
asynchronous scanning thing, but it does allocate the actual host
device nodes serially, and then it even has an ordered list of
"scanning_hosts" that is used to complete the scanning in-order, so
that the sysfs devices show up in the right order even if things
actually got scanned out-of-order. So scans that finished early will
wait for other scans that are for "earlier" devices, and you end up
with what *looks* ordered to the outside, even if internally it was
all done out-of-order.
