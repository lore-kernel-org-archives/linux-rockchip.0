Dear Mark,
Thanks for your reply.

Because we are trying to bring rt5650 in the project, so we intend to=20
describe supported codecs with DTS via only a rockchip machine driver f=
ile,
others remain pre-implement(like max98090 / rt5645 that vendor machine=20
driver).
I communicated with Dylan, and he told me that the jack detection is an=
=20
issue in the simple-card, and suggested we are better to send them at=20
present.

Thanks.
