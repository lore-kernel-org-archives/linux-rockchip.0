One also needs to use runtime PM to handle power domains and power
dependencies on auxiliary devices, e.g. IOMMU.

For this driver, I suppose we would _get_sync() when we start
streaming (in the hardware, i.e. we want the ISP to start capturing
frames) and _put() when we stop and the driver shouldn't perform any
access to the hardware when the streaming is not active.
