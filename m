Well, I can test it again with r12p0 kernel driver (out-of-tree)
if you want.  The user-space driver checks the version of the
kernel driver and gives up if it's not compatible.  With Midgard,
there's a range of versions that maintain kernel/userspace
compatibility unlike Utgard and older Midgard releases where they
had to exactly match.  Again, if there was a mismatch then the
user-space would fail to initialise and report an error.

Sounds like a new SoC?  Does rk3288w affect rk3288 in any way?

Unless it's a special case, it seems to me that any new SoC with
a Midgard GPU would need an extra vendor compatible string in the
binding documentation and maybe a separate gpu dt node.

Thanks!
