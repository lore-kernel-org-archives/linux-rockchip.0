It doesn't look natural to free it in probe, instead it looks more
like we should do the cleanup work when calling .remove

I didn't know if there is something that still use this resource
, for instance, hotplug? But I noticed it from Bjron's statement[1]
that "The struct resource for each host bridge window must live as long
as the host bridge itself". So I didn't free it when finishing probe.
I guess the proper fix is to do it in pci_remove_root_bus or somewhere
of the cleanup code if I undertand it correctly.
