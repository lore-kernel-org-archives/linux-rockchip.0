I feel like I am losing my mind here lol. Forget about this patch for a
moment and consider the driver right now. The code currently looks like
this:
	if (rkvdec->variant->has_single_reg_region) {
		rkvdec->regs =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->regs))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->regs);
	} else {
		rkvdec->regs =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(pdev, "function");
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->regs))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->regs);

		rkvdec->link =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(pdev, "link");
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->link))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->link);
	}
This means you will fail to probe on any platform that does not have
has_single_reg_region set if the reg-names property is not present.
rk3588-vdec uses:
	static const struct rkvdec_variant vdpu381_variant =3D {
		.coded_fmts =3D vdpu381_coded_fmts,
		.num_coded_fmts =3D ARRAY_SIZE(vdpu381_coded_fmts),
		.rcb_sizes =3D vdpu381_rcb_sizes,
		.num_rcb_sizes =3D ARRAY_SIZE(vdpu381_rcb_sizes),
		.ops =3D &vdpu381_variant_ops,
	};
The binding does not currently require rk3588-vdec use reg-names. This
means that the driver will fail to probe if someone provides what the
binding considers to be a valid devicetree.

There are two ways to resolve this. The first is to do the following:
| diff --git a/drivers/media/platform/rockchip/rkvdec/rkvdec.c b/drivers/me=
dia/platform/rockchip/rkvdec/rkvdec.c

|  			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->link);
|  	}

The second is to make the reg-names property mandatory.

The first way does not constitute an ABI break. The second way is an ABI
break, as you rightly point out.

Now thinking about your patch here. Without it, the following is a valid
vdec node on rk3588.
	video-codec@fdc38000 {
		compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3588-vdec";
		reg =3D <0x0 0xfdc38100 0x0 0x500>,

		sram =3D <&vdec0_sram>;
	};
Ignore the fact that this will not currently probe for a moment, assuming
we applied my diff above to the driver, and look at what will be a valid
node after your patch:
	video-codec@fdc38000 {
		compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3588-vdec";
		reg =3D <0x0 0xfdc38000 0x0 0x100>,
		      <0x0 0xfdc38100 0x0 0x500>,

		assigned-clock-rates =3D <800000000>, <600000000>,

			 <&cru SRST_RKVDEC0_CORE>, <&cru SRST_RKVDEC0_HEVC_CA>;
		reset-names =3D "axi", "ahb", "cabac", "core", "hevc_cabac";
		sram =3D <&vdec0_sram>;
	};
Driver is going to break here, cos it will pick up the link region and
set rkvdec->regs to it!

So, the only way to accommodate the deprecated scheme and the new scheme
is to use the reg-names property (as the driver currently does).

So yes, while what I propose is an ABI break, the driver currently
expects reg-names to be mandatory for the rk3588-vdec. Additionally, new
required properties are only really a meaningful ABI break if the driver
is changed to required them, since that would render old devicetrees
non-functional. The driver in question already requires them, so that's
pretty moot! Were it not for your patch here, I would say that my diff
should be applied to the driver instead of making the property required.

reg-names is a dependency for your ABI-annihilation, as my example above
demonstrates, so I find it really bemusing that you're worried about its
impact!

Hopefully I've made my point about reg-names being mandatory this time
around?

Cheers,
Conor.
