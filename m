Side note: why is this driver even requesting a shared IRQ? This is for
rk3399, and the IRQ is a dedicated GIC interrupt for the PCIe
controller. It shouldn't need to be 'shared'.

The problem still might not be *only* theoretical though, since it's
still possible for this non-shared interrupt to
(a) trigger
(b) concurrently, we remove/tear down (including disable clocks)
(c) we service the IRQ      <-- dead, because clock is disabled
(d) if we ever got here... free_irq()
