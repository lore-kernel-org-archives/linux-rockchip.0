Ah, I now see what you mean. Yeah, this is a bit rubbish. It would have
been better if the API returned something more sensible in that case,
but that's a bit late...

I don't think anyone noticed. !CONFIG_PM on something like rk3399
probably isn't very popular, and certainly comes for free on a
multiplatform kernel.

Yup.

Not stupid at all. Regarding this very patch: where do you want me to
take it?
