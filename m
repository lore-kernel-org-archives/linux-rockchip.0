It would be interesting to know if the "retry-count" ought to be the
same across all Chromebooks.  I guess you could argue that maybe
someone found it needed to be 10 in all "nyan" variants and needed to
be 1 in all "veyron" variants, but it seems more likely that the
difference is arbitrary, or that one of the two values would work for
everyone.  It sure looks like we've just been copying values from
device to device.  Given that all the "veyron" devices have vastly
different batteries (and probably all the nyan ones too), it seems
likely there ought to be one value.

In terms of setting the "charger", that also could potentially be
something that could be for all Chromebooks, or at least older ones
that don't have their charger implemented by the type C driver.  ...or
nyan devices could simply have a line in their dts like:

&battery {
  power-supplies =3D <&charger>;
};

For gru devices, we've moved to a "virtual sbs battery" provided by
the EC.  I'm not 100% positive that everything will just magically
work and be converted in the EC if we put a non-sbs battery on a board
with this EC feature, but I would hope we'd convert everything
properly.

Arguably this should be fixed.  On veyron-chromebook we just use
"gpio-charger".  We didn't add a special charger driver w/ a property
like "ti,external-control" since the only piece of information that
Linux really needed from the charger was whether or not AC was
connected.

I'm fine with whatever you guys choose to do here.  It's nice not to
have copied "code", but with device tree sometimes copies are cleaner
than trying to share something.
