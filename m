Thanks!

Patch 4 seems like it should be fine (it was discussed previously, but
never done).

Apart from existing leaks in the PCI framework (which Jeffy and Shawn
are trying to patch [1]), I don't think there are any known issues with
3 and 5. It's certainly better than having 100% broken unbind at least,
IMO.

I suppose it's worth getting an ack/nack from Shawn though.
