This is annoying as it makes submission of CEC support for dw-hdmi
rather difficult due to the now horrid cross-tree dependencies:

* if I submit it to the DRM tree, the DRM tree will build break because
  you don't have the necessary CEC changes which have recently been
  merged into the media tree.

* if I submit it to the media tree, the new files will be placed into
  drivers/gpu/drm/bridge and when stuff gets merged into linux-next
  and/or Linus' tree, things will need quite a large fixup (someone
  will have to rename the files and fix the Kconfig/Makefiles.)

So, I'll hold it back for another cycle to avoid the mess that would
result from trying to get it merged during this cycle.
