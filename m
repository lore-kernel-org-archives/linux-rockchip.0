Agree.

And the driver is assuming the first node is the clockevent and the second one
is the clocksource. If the DT invert these nodes, that breaks the driver.

Well, 'interrupt' gives an indication the timer can be used as a clockevent and
clocksource, not the clockevent only.

If we take the case of the rockchip, the arm_arch_timer clocksource is stopped
when the CPU is clock gated. So specifically, we don't want to use this
clocksource but we want to use the arch clockevents because they are better.

IIUC my discussion with Rob, an attribute is acceptable (btw if
'clocksource'|'clockevent' names are too Linux specific (+1), what
about a more generic name like 'tick' and 'time' ?).

IMO, the core code is complex enough and that may imply more heuristics.
Regarding the number of timers, I do believe it is much better to simply tell
which one we want to use via the DT (assuming the DT is a description of the
desired hardware, not all the available hardware).
