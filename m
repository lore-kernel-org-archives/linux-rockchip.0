The mask is suggested by Moritz Fischer in V2[0]. And I found Tegra did=
=20
indeed only use some bits of one register to store the reboot mode[1].

@Heiko: It seems that this patch series can land now, but the dts parts=
=20
belong to  two different branch(arm32 and arm64) . And these
two parts both depends on one head file rockchip_boot-mode.h, So I hope=
=20
some suggestions from you how to deal with it.
