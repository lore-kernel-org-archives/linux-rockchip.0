Good Morning Heiko,

Here's a quick catch-up for you:
Currently we use thresh dma mode to allow rgmii to work, but this has 
performance limitations.
Leonidas submitted the txpbl 0x4 patch, which works well for his board 
but my board has very poor performance with.
I submitted a new patch that combined txpbl 0x4 with aal dma mode, which 
fixes my issue and seems to work well for Leonidas.

That patch is under [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: improve rk3328-roc-cc 
rgmii performance.
I'd like more people to test it prior to submitting it to replace thresh 
dma mode.

If we get a few more tests without regression, I'll resubmit it with 
Tested-by tags for inclusion.

Thanks,
Peter
