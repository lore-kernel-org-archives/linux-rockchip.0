All this I agree with, but it almost always starts with a compatible
that matches the device, not a compatible for the protocol. When
adding control for different devices diverge, then they need different
compatibles. Ideally, we'd start with all the supplies and control
lines defined for a binding, so we don't have so much evolving of
bindings. But obviously we can't always get things 100% complete to
start with, so we have to let them evolve. And I can't go read every
datasheet, but I do go read them sometimes for reviews.

A new compatible is enhancing the binding IMO. I'm just saying you
need both the compatible and the added properties. Whether the power
on delay should be a property or implied by the compatible is somewhat
debatable, but I'm okay with having it because we already do on other
bindings. What I'm not okay with is "simple" or "generic" bindings
that continually evolve with additional properties to handle more and
more complex cases. DT is not a scripting language. This has been
discussed countless times before...

Sounds like this should be a fixable problem.
