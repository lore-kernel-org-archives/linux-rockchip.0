Hi Jaehoon and Ulf,

   This patch is gonna support runtime PM for dw_mmc.
It could support to disable ciu_clk by default and disable
biu_clk if the devices are non-removeable, or removeable
with gpio-base card detect.

   Then I remove the system PM since the runtime PM actually
does the same thing as it. So I help migrate the dw_mmc variant
drivers to use runtime PM pairs and pm_runtime_force_*. Note
that I only enable runtime PM for dw_mmc-rockchip as I will
leave the decision to the owners of the corresponding drivers.
I just tested it on my RK3288 platform with linux-next to make
the runtime PM and system PM work fine for my emmc, sd card and
sdio. But I don't have hardware to help test other variant drivers.
But in theory it should work fine as I mentioned that the runtime
PM does the same thing as system PM except for disabling ciu_clk
aggressively which should not be related to the variant hosts.

   As you could see that I just extend the slot-gpio a bit, so the
ideal way is Ulf could pick them up with Jaehoon's ack. :)
