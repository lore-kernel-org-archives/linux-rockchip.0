did the above alleviate your concerns a bit or is there more to talk about?

As described above we need the clock tree early on and these supplying 
external clocks are also very deeply embedded in it as they're most of the 
time supplies for clock muxes and might get selected or simply ignored if the 
supplying clock is not present at the time of a clock operation.

I also don't think that this is linux-specific, as other OSes would have the 
same issue to solve with Rockchip clock trees and I don't think rewriting 
clock-trees at runtime is an option on any system when one of the possible 
circular supplies appears some 20 seconds after the core clock tree or so.

And that softer link allows the clock system of any OS to figure this out once 
those later clocks appear or stay away.
