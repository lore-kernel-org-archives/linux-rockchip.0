Thanks for comment.

yup, but what is the proper way to add it ? :)


a) If pl330 support BURST as well as all the peripherals, we could
enable it.

b) If pl300 support BURST, but all the peripherals don't support it,
we could not enable it.

c) If pl300 support BURST, but not all the peripherals support it,
we also could not enable it.

the burst feature of peripheral IP may be vendor-specific, but the
common driver for this peripheral are used for many many vendors which
means we could not check all of this info. It's very likely to break
them... I couldn't figure out how many upstreamed peripheral drivers
who are using pl300 either.

So this check should be done by all this vendors but we could make
sure we don't break them before they check a), b), c), right?
