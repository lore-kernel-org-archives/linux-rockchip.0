Sorry I don't get this patch at all. We shouldn't be handing out clocks
to consumers if the clock is an orphan. We also have a problem syncing
enable state in the framework with what is there in hardware when we
boot up. These aren't the same problem but they're related. Let's not
conflate the two.
