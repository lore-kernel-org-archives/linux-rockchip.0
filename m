These could be out of tree.

There is a version outside the kernel tree where you just point the CI
configuration to a url:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gfx-ci/drm-ci/-/merge_requests/1

We were discussing it here 
https://www.linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/linuxtv-ci/2023-August/000027.html

(I guess Sima's reply didn't got into the mailing list) but the argument 
of not having out of tree repo is due to historical bad experience of 
having to sync the kernel with the code and it can become messy.

We can improve this if this is a requirement.
For DTS configuration we can work with overlays (which is the current 
modification on that patchset). For other changes that are not suitable 
to upstream (and should be rare) we can see if we work with the 
`-external-fixes` approach or another approach, we can check it case by 
case to understand why it is not suitable for upstream.

I believe we need a baseline and understand the current status of tests. 
If you check the xfails folder in the patch you can see that I had to 
add a few tests on *-skips.txt since those tests crashes the system and 
other on *-fails.txt that are consistently not passing.

Since the "any IGT test we enable for a given platform should work" is 
not a reality atm, we need to have a clear view about which tests are 
not corresponding to it, so we can start fixing. First we need to be 
aware of the issues so we can start fixing them, otherwise we will stay 
in the "no tests no failures" ground :)

This is something that is really nice on Mesa3D, a patch only gets 
merged if tests passes, which forces people to not ignore it, which 
forces the code to be fixed and the CI to be constantly maintained.

Of course there are bad days there, but there is real value. Nice thread 
to check: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8635 (thanks 
Alyssa for the feedback).

At least we would know what is there that isn't reliable.
We could also define policies like: failing one out of 10 is fine. And 
we can have scripts that do a stress test and report back.
It is really nice for users to know this kind of status of drivers.


Thanks for your feedback, please keep them coming :)

Regards,
Helen
