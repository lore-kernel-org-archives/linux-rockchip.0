Well, the catch here is that status=disabled doesn't necessarily mean
that the IP block isn't present.  It can mean "not used", "not needed",
"not wired up to external iface" etc., but if the IP block is physcially
present, then its clocks are still needed for a power domain reset.  If
a node is marked as status=disabled, then even the fallback compatible
doesn't help, as the fallback driver won't be probed/loaded either. :(

Speaking of loading, the module loading/unloading complicates this even
further.  Even if a pm-domain is managing the clocks from a device node,
if a driver is unloaded (and thus removed from the pm domain), the pm
domain driver would stop managing that clock and then the domain reset
would stop working again.  Ugh.  

The more I think through all these corner cases, and also the fact that
we never seem to be able to get a fully accurate description of how the
SoCs actually work at this level (due to missing/poor/wrong docs), I
think the having both the power domain and the device nodes claiming
clocks is the most flexible solution. It's using the clock consumer
binding in a perfectly acceptable way, and the clock fwk usecounting
will manage usecounting etc.

However, I still stick by my earlier insistence that the DT nodes be
thorougly documented though, and be very specific why the clocks are
needed by the power domain, and especially which clocks are device
clocks, etc.  I (and hopefully others) will be looking closely at the
DTs that come through and make that clocks listed in the domains are
well described.

@Doug: thanks for taking the time to spell out the variou corner cases.
