Looking closer at my old commits, it was the PCLK_GPU_ROOT that was
needed for e.g. RK3576 and RK3528. This clock is not described in RK3588
clock tree so it never gets disabled by Linux clock framework.

I suspect similarly one of the NPU root clocks is what drives the NPU
PVTPLL and thus always must be kept enabled when PVTPLL mode is used.

Jonas
