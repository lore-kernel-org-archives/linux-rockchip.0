The patch

   ASoC: rockchip: i2s: fix playback after runtime resume

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rockchip: i2s: fix playback after runtime resume

When restoring registers during runtime resume, we must not write to
I2S_TXDR which is the transmit FIFO as this queues up a sample to be
output and pushes all of the output channels down by one.

This can be demonstrated with the speaker-test utility:

	for i in a b c; do speaker-test -c 2 -s 1; done

which should play a test through the left speaker three times but if the
I2S hardware starts runtime suspended the first sample will be played
through the right speaker.

Fix this by marking I2S_TXDR as volatile (which also requires marking it
as readble, even though it technically isn't).  This seems to be the
most robust fix, the alternative of giving I2S_TXDR a default value is
more fragile since it does not prevent regcache writing to the register
in all circumstances.

While here, also fix the configuration of I2S_RXDR and I2S_FIFOLR; these
are not writable so they do not suffer from the same problem as I2S_TXDR
but reading from I2S_RXDR does suffer from a similar problem.
