ok, so if I'm not mistaken it really looks like moving away from
cros-sbs-battery might be the easiest solution and with seeing the
different usages of the sbs-battery I tend to agree now :-) .

On the include vs. copy question it looks like we're tied as well with
mickey, minnie (and fievel + tiger from 2017) not using the sbs-battery
having local copies of the sbs-node in the affected devices really looks
like the best option.

So I guess we should get gru + the sbs veyron-devices their own sbs-battery
and then just drop te cros-ec-sbs.dtsi so that nobody else gets the idea
of using it.
