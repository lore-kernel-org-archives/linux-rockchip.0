Correct me if I'm wrong, but the main problem here is that, when we try
to detect the initial regulator state, we ran into a "missing entry in
the duty-cycle <-> voltage table" error, which then triggers an -EINVAL
error preventing the PWM regulator probe to succeed.

Of course, adding an entry for the 0% dutycle case would solve the
issue, but I wonder if we should not allow "unknown value" at probe
time, and let the regulator user set the voltage output when it claims
it.

Another option would be to fake a valid value in this case (choose the
closest entry in the voltage table?).
