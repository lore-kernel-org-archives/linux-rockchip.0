Not quite a year, but the status is still the same ;)

By the way, I do not quite understand why we want to mess with
emulated temperature when hardware reports errors. I'd say when
get_temp() fails we need to let upper layers know right away. Only
when we read temperature successfully and we are sure that the
temperature is not above critical level we should allow reporting
emulated value.

Can we please apply the patch?

Thanks.
