The TRM says for me for that bit only "pcie_clkreq_sel port control" an=
d=20
that naming really suggests that it is a property of the pcie controlle=
r,=20
not the generic pinctrl. So if this needs to be touched the pcie contro=
ller=20
needs to do it.

What I meant was that while clock handling is important when looking at=
 the=20
whole system, the pcie controller itself does only care that it gets a=20
clock, but not that much where you get it from.

So while assigned-clocks has its place in the real devicetree, I don't =
think=20
it is an element of the actual pcie-controller binding.
