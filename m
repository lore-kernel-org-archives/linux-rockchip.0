Thankfully the clock diagrams on the old socs were pretty verbose, listing all
grf-based clocks as well. For example the rk3288 seems to have two and it
seems I've been carrying dummy definitions for those from the time I did the
initial clock tree [0].

And thankfully grf-based clocks somehow always only get used for more
"esotheric" components like vcodec and iep on the rk3288 :-) .

[0] https://github.com/mmind/linux-rockchip/blob/devel/workbench/drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-rk3288.c
lines 371 and 799 .. looks like I'll need to add the iep clock as well
at some point.
