One note is that in the case Brian points at (where we need to
simulate EDGE_BOTH by swapping edges) we purposely ignored the TRM and
we needed to do that to avoid losing interrupts.  For details, see
commit 53b1bfc76df2 ("pinctrl: rockchip: Avoid losing interrupts when
supporting both edges").  We did this because:

1. We believed that the IP block in Rockchip SoCs has nearly the same
logic as "gpio-dwapb.c" and that's what "gpio-dwapb.c" did.

2. We were actually losing real interrupts and this was the only way
we could figure out how to fix it.

When I tested that back in the day I was fairly convinced that we
weren't losing any interrupts in the EDGE_BOTH case after my fix, but
I certainly could have messed up.


For the EDGE_BOTH case it was important not to lose an interrupt
because, as you guys are talking about, we could end up configured the
wrong way.  I think in your case where you're just picking one
polarity losing an interrupt shouldn't matter since it's undefined
exactly if an edge happens while you're in the middle of executing
rockchip_irq_set_type().  Is that right?
