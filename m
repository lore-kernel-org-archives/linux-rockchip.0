Are you sure that removing the workaround just doesn't result in the
same bug as on iMX6 appearing?  The bug concerned is the ordering of
the channels, so unless you're (eg0 monitoring left/right separately
or directing audio to just one channel, you may not (with modern TVs)
realise that the channels are swapped.  I'll include the errata
description and impact below.

There are occasional issues on iMX6 as well despite this work-around,
but I don't clearly remember what devmem2 tweaks I've done in the past
to get it to resolve itself, nor could I describe them from memory
any better than "burbling audio".


  When the AHB Audio DMA is started, by setting to 1'b1 for the first
  time the register field AHB_DMA_START.data_buffer_ready, the AHB
  Audio DMA will request data from the AHB bus to fill its internal
  AHB DMA FIFO. It is possible that a AHB DMA FIFO read action occurs
  during the time window between the first sample stored on the AHB
  DMA FIFO and when the AHB DMA FIFO has stored, at least, the number
  of configured audio channels in samples. If this happens, the AHB
  DMA FIFO will reply with samples that are currently on the AHB
  Audio FIFO and will repeat the last sample after the empty condition
  is reached.

  Projected Impact:
  This will miss-align the audio stream, causing a shift in the
  distribution of audio on the channels on the HDMI sink side, with no
  knowledge of the DWC_hdmi_tx enabled system.


If you know that this definitely does not apply to your version, then
we need to split the audio enable/disable functions between the AHB
and I2S variants.
