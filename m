Yea. I need to figure out the best way to represent these various metho=
ds in DT.

Apologies for not being super responsive here. Been a bit heads down
trying to finish up some items before holiday break.

=46rom some of Arnd's comments, it sounds like we may need a larger
generic subsystem for kernel to firmware communications here.  So more
then likely I'll not have a chance to take another swing at this after
the new year.

So if in the meantime you want to try to take my code and rework it,
or extend your code in a similar way, I'll not take any offence. :)

thanks
