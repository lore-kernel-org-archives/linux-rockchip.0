I wasn't very clear, but the PMC_SCRATCH0 register is used to store the
reset reason. It supports the recovery mode, which I think is really an
Android thing, "bootloader" will typically cause the bootloader not to
boot anything, and "forced-recovery" will go into a recovery mode that
is used to bootstrap the device (usually by uploading a "miniloader"
that initializes RAM, downloads a bootloader for booting or flashing an
operating system, ...).

The write that resets the SoC is to a different register.
