From the patch description it looks like the clock is expected to be 
controlled from firmware in most cases as I guess the Cortex M0 will be used 
for that all the time now. And the clock is not expected to run all the time.

So I'd think clk_ignore_unused is the correct one. The whole clock-subtree for 
these clocks also does not get affected by other clocks, as it is 
independendly coming from PLLs.
