I don't think that is a case of "preference". GRF_SOC_CON0[7] indicates
that value 0 means vepu gets selected as vcodec clock and value 1 means
vdpu gets selected as vcodec.

The array values below are supposed to match these values, so array
index 0 represents the clock for value 0 and so on. So this is really only
a description of the hardware clock layout.

If you want to actually switch the mux value, please assign the vcodec
clock an id and use the assigned-clocks mechanism in the devicetree.
