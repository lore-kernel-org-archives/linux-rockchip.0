I'm hoping that someone upstream might have some time to test and
review these three patches since I believe that they fix a regression
in 4.14.  I pinged Shawn Lin and found that it's a Chinese holiday
right now so he won't be able to test util next week, but presumably
others might be noticing problems with SD cards or eMMC using dw_mmc
on kernel 4.14, especially with serial console enabled?

Adding linux-rockchip to the CC here.  Original patches can be found
on patchwork.kernel.org...

Thanks!
