Even without bkops enable, no matter for manual or auto one, FTL should
always do bkops like GC internally when needed to guarantee the
performance and balance the wear leveling. What I thought to do is to
make it more explicitly.

Because then, what

When power off notification is sent, bkops will be stopped
in _mmc_suspend. So I don't undertand your point here?

And why is AUTO_EN persistent across

Ahh, that's a problem need to be fixed, thanks for reminding.
