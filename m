OK...but it has a bug. It potentially utilizes an uninitialized value
for *temp.

OK, maybe, but you should avoid doing this comparison then:

513                 if (!ret && *temp < crit_temp)
514                         *temp = tz->emul_temperature;

Note that 'ret' might be 0 (from the calls to ->get_trip_type()), and then
you're comparing with the uninitialized value of *temp. So you need some
solution that accounts for this and decides to ignore the real
temperature properly.

Yes...are you saying the same thing I am above?

Honestly I didn't look that deeply into the framework here (and I also
don't use CONFIG_THERMAL_EMULATION), I was just fixing something that
was obviously wrong.

But on first read, that patch looks good to me -- although it'd be good
to note the uninitialized value fix in the comit log. Any reason that
didn't end up getting merged? It looks like it got reviewed, and you're
a thermal subsystem maintainer...
