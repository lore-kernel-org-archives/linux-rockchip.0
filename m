Thierry, I see the PWM core converts the bit field "third cell" into
the polarity variable.
Now I probably understand your sight and agree that we shouldn't give
the same names to bits in bitfield (dts) and values of a variable.

But there are lots of useless "0" values of third cell of "pwms"
option in dts files.

I see 2 ways now:
- just remove all "0" "third cell" from "pwms" options in dts files. I
see this "0" confuses some people.
- convert pwm_state.polarity into pwm_state.flags and use bitfield
directly from dtb.
  It simplifies the parsing logic and makes adding new flags easier.

What do think?
