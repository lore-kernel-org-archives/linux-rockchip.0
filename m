Based on your other patch, this is temporary, right?

I've been looking at DRM a lot lately. I think specifying the i2c bus
in the hdmi chip or IP block node is wrong. If the I2C host is
separate from the HDMI block, then it's only connection is to the HDMI
connector. So the I2C host to the connector relationship is what the
DT should describe. HPD gpio is similar. Now if the HDMI bridge
controls DDC and HPD directly, then we don't need to describe those
connections.
