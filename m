Self-review after running this on a Rock 5B+. The reorder closes the
clk leak, but it opens a window I missed when I sent it.
Moving the PM teardown ahead of rkvdec_v4l2_cleanup() is necessary,
for the drvdata reason in the commit message. The side effect is that
video_unregister_device() is now the last thing remove() does, so
/dev/videoN stays open-able while the empty IOMMU domain is already
freed.
A job queued in that window reaches rkvdec_iommu_restore() and touches
the freed domain. Before the reorder, cleanup ran first and the window
did not exist.
Splitting the helper keeps both properties: unregister the media and
video devices first, which stops new jobs, then tear down PM, then
release the m2m and V4L2 device. Only that last step clears drvdata,
so rkvdec_runtime_suspend() still finds its state.

   cancel_delayed_work_sync(&rkvdec->watchdog_work);

   rkvdec_v4l2_unregister(rkvdec); /* media + video unregister */

   pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend(&pdev->dev);

   if (rkvdec->empty_domain)
     iommu_domain_free(rkvdec->empty_domain);

   pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev);
   rkvdec_v4l2_release(rkvdec); /* media cleanup, m2m, v4l2 */

Running here on 7.2-rc5: unbind then rebind returns the rkvdec clock
enable counts to their pre-unbind values and /dev/video0 comes back.
I can send this as a v5 carrying both changes, or as a follow-up patch
on top of v4, whichever you prefer.
Thanks,
Francesco
