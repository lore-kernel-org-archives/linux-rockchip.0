Just like every other Rockhip device, the MMC "_sample" clocks should
have a shift of 0, not a shift of 1.  The rk3399 TRM agrees.  Presumably
these values were set to 0 because of a typo.

Things _sorta_ would have worked with the incorrect sample phase shift
because of the register layout but wouldn't have been ideal and we would
have skipped lots of phases.  Also: we would never actually enabled the
fine delay unless we happened to have 128 or more delay elements.

This is expected behavior before this patch:
* Try to set:     0 degrees +   1 delay elements
  Actually get:   0 degrees +   0 delay elements
* Try to set:    90 degrees +   0 delay elements
  Actually get: 180 degrees +   0 delay elements
* Try to set:   180 degrees +   0 delay elements
  Actually get:   0 degrees +   0 delay elements
* Try to set:   270 degrees +   0 delay elements
  Actually get: 180 degrees +   0 delay elements
* Try to set:     0 degrees + 129 delay elements
  Actually get:   0 degrees +   2 delay elements
* Try to set:   180 degrees + 129 delay elements
  Actually get:   0 degrees +   3 delay elements
* Try to set:     0 degrees + 130 delay elements
  Actually get:   0 degrees +   4 delay elements

I verified that old code had a problem by turning on debug printouts and
seeing that the old code would report this for one SD card I had:
  Good phase range 347-101 (115 len)
  Good phase range 202-326 (125 len)

After my fix, it went down to one big good range for the same card.
This is more expected:
  Good phase range 189-1 (173 len)
  Good phase range 82-85 (4 len)
  Good phase range 166-168 (3 len)
