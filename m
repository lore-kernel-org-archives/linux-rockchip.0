nearly, but not quite ;-)

You can take a look at my minnie patch [0] for inspiration.


Also please make sure to include linus.walleij@linaro.org also in this
first mail. This clock patch is a prequisite for the pinctrl change so
we would like Linus Walleij to merge both into his pinctrl tree.

Ideally both times in the "To" and not the "Cc" recipients, as To vs. Cc
is often used to distinguish whom you want to apply the patch.
