In commit 802ac39a5566 ("mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: fix set_clock when a phy
is supported") we added code to power the PHY off and on whenever the
clock was changed but we avoided doing the power cycle code when the
clock was low speed.  Let's now do it always.

Although there may be other reasons for power cycling the PHY when the
clock changes, one of the main reasons is that we need to give the DLL a
chance to re-lock with the new clock.

One of the things that the DLL is for is tuning the Receive Clock in
HS200 mode and STRB in HS400 mode.  Thus it is clear that we should make
sure we power cycle the PHY (and wait for the DLL to lock) when we know
we'll be in one of these two speed modes.  That's what the original code
did, though it used the clock rate rather than the speed mode.  However,
even in speed modes other than HS200,/HS400 the DLL is used for
something since it can be clearly observed that the PHY doesn't function
properly if you leave the DLL off.

Although it appears less important to power cycle the PHY and wait for
the DLL to lock when not in HS200/HS400 modes (no bugs were reported),
it still seems wise to let the locking always happen nevertheless.

Note: as part of this, we make sure that we never try to turn the PHY on
when the clock is off (when the clock rate is 0).  The PHY cannot work
when the clock is off since its DLL can't lock.

This change requires ("phy: rockchip-emmc: Increase lock time
allowance") and will cause problems if picked without that change.
