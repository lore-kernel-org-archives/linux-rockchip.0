I don't agree that pcie controller should do it. As a common driver, it
should not care two much setting related to io selection which is very
likely to be changed in the future Socs. Shuld it always keep a
reference to bit[ABC] of GRF_SOC_CONXYZ, and should it adds some code
to see which IO is selected for #CLKREQ?

Currently I do it in firmware, but it's worth to make some discussion
as there are also some IO backup slelections the GRF of RK3399. Anyway,
let's skip this topic from the $SUBJECT patch.

Oh, I see.. So it seems good to keep all the assigned-clocks in on
place. I will remove it from this patch.
