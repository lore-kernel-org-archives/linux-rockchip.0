Not sure if it's worth it at this point, but it would have helped me
if the high speed support was separated into a separate CL.  Then I
could have focused on basic support first and later tried to
understand all the high speed stuff.

I'd suggest putting the devicetree bindings in a separate patch and CC
the device tree mailing list.  Presumably you can get an Ack for the
bindings.  Once you have an Ack on the bindings, presumably you could
start posting and landing device trees that use the bindings.

I don't think your change applies cleanly to Wolfram's for-next
branch.  Please rebase.  See:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git/log/?h=3Di2c=
/for-next

Specifically rk3228 landed there and your patch doesn't account for it.

=46rom the binding it's unclear the the first clock was not specified b=
y
name (it just needed to be the first clock) and that the second clock
needed to be specified by name.

Personally I'd rather see names be part of the binding for newer
hardware, so I'd do something like this:

 - clocks: See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt
   - For older hardware (rk3066, rk3188, rk3228, rk3288):
     - There is one clock that's used both to derive the functional clo=
ck
       for the device and as the bus clock.  REQUIRED.
   - For newer hardware (rk3399): specify by name
     - "i2c": REQUIRED. This is used to derive the functional clock.
     - "pclk": REQUIRED. This is the bus clock.

If you thought that a name other than "i2c" made more sense for the
functional clock you could do that.

This example is not correct for rk3288, which shouldn't have a GRF
specified.  No need to have an example for every SoC, so I'd just say
that this is an example for rk3188 only.

I don't know nothin' about I2C, but some searching finds this
<http://www.i2c-bus.org/addressing/high-speed/>:

* The master codes are selectable by the designer and allow up to
eight high speed masters to be connected in one system

* master code =E2=80=9800001000=E2=80=99 should be reserved for test an=
d diagnostic purposes

Presumably you should pick something else (like 0x09) and add a note
that if we need to support multi-master we should allow per-board
configuration (device tree?) for this.

Can you add some sort of comment indicating that sda_update_cfg,
stp_sta_cfg, and stp_sto_cfg should all be 0 for old hardware (anyone
using rk3x_i2c_v0_calc_timings)?

nit: include a unit, so fs_clock_hz and hs_clock_hz.  This also helps
make it more obvious that these are not pointers to a 'struct clk'.

nit: "count" is confusing here.  A better word would be "adjustment"
or "tuning", like:

rk3x_i2c_get_fs_adjustment
  -or-
rk3x_i2c_get_fs_tuning

Also: is there really a reason to do all these shifts and ORs every
time?  Why not just calculate the proper initial u32 and just store it
somewhere?

There is no error parameter.  Remove comment?

Might not hurt to mention in the comment that this is only used in
high speed mode?

I guess you removed this because it was redundant?  It looks like
previously we would always call rk3x_i2c_setup() before
rk3x_i2c_start() and the last thing in setup was to clean the IPD, so
no reason to do it at the beginning of start.  Is that right?

Would be very helpful to do that in a change by itself because then I
wouldn't have had to figure all this out myself.  ...and it would be
more obvious to other readers that this is an unrelated change.

nit: you have an extra space before the "1".  Clean up.

optional: you could use "t_calc->div_high--" but no idea if it's cleane=

Boy, sure seems like it would be nice to somehow share these values
between the two functions.  Maybe we can create some structures with
the union of both sets of data and then add a function that gets the
right structure?  Like:

struct i2c_spec_values {
  unsigned long min_low_ns;
  unsigned long setup_start_ns;
  unsigned long stop_setup_ns; /* should be setup_stop_ns ? */
  unsigned long min_high_ns;
  unsigned long min_data_setup_ns;
  unsigned long max_data_hold_n;
  unsigned long hold_buffer_ns;
};

const struct standard_spec =3D {
  .min_low_ls =3D 4700,
  .setup_start_ns =3D 4700,
  ...
};

Then use with:

spec =3D rk3x_get_spec(t->bus_freq_hz);

You have slightly different logic than _v0 because if either div_low
or div_high needs to be too big you'll set them _both_ to max.

Specifically imagine if div_low =3D 0x10000 and div_high =3D 0x8000.  T=
he
_v0 code would end up picking div_low =3D 0xffff and leaving div_high a=
t
0x8000.  Your code will set them both to 0xffff.  I would argue that
the old code is slightly more correct, but I guess that could be up
for debate.

Does it matter since we're returning an error code?  Probably not, but
you never know.  The error code is used to try to stop clock
transitions, but if (somehow) the clock transition happens anyway or
if you've got to deal with a bad clock at boot time then it _could_
matter.

It's unlikely that we'll get into this situation in a well-designed
system, so it probably doesn't matter too much but:

* We should minimize unnecessary diffs between _v0 and _v1 so they're
easier to compare and reason about.  So if we pick your new scheme we
should change the _v0 code to match.  ...and it would be nice if this
were in a separate patch to make things easier to reason about.

* The old code isn't broken that I know of, so I'd prefer not to
change it and just have _v1 match.

Why the "if" test.  Presumably it's illegal to have calc_timings be NUL=
L?

This is pretty ugly.  Probably better to make two copies of these
timings at probe time and then modify it then.  It's unexpected that
you'd be dynamically modifying this structure during operation that is
populated at probe time.

Note: that means you can totally remove your fs_clock and hs_clock
variables I think.

As I understand it, this is wrong.  If you get a rate change you need
to make sure you'll be able to properly make _both_ the high speed and
full speed clocks (or, if you have no high speed clock, just the full
speed clock).

Remember that this bit of code is just supposed to do error checking
so that we can stop a bad rate change before it happens.  Actually,
adding a comment to that effect wouldn't hurt...

* CRASH *

=2E..at least that's what happened when I ran this code in the virtual
machine of my brain.  calc_timings() now stores its results in the
memory pointed to by the last parameter.  In your case I think that
points into LaLa land.

It would probably be sane to find some way to run this code.  Perhaps
you can find someone nearby that has one of the old rockchip SoCs
where the i2c clock is based off the same PLL as cpufreq?

OK, so you moved this into rk3x_i2c_start() because sometimes you
don't go straight to that state.  Makes sense.  For debugging
purposes, do you think it makes sense to add a STATE_SETUP?  That way
we can still init to something here and if we ever get an unexpected
interrupt we'll know that we did the setup but never made it to start
or mastercode?

Technically you could probably disable the pclk while waiting for the
interrupt.  Not sure if it's worth it.  Might be a small power
savings...

Technically there could be reasons why someone would want a different
fs_clock here (like if there were 100kHz devices on the same bus as a
High Speed device), but I guess that's unlikely and we can always deal
with it when we get there.

As you could maybe tell from the bindings, I'd do this differently.

Old code and old bindings specified no name for the clocks.  So for
old hardware we need to preserve the call:

  devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL);

=46or new hardware I think it probably makes sense to require names.  S=
o
I'd probably do something like:

1. Put all clock getting together.  No reason to get one clock at the
top of the function and the other clock down here.

2. Check for new hardware with "soc_data->calc_timings =3D=3D
rk3x_i2c_v1_calc_timings".  If new hardware, get by name.

3. I don't see any reason for the extra 'of_property_match_string(np,
"clock-names", "pclk");' bit.  Just try to get the clocks if it's new
hardware.

4. Technically I think you need to check for -EPROBE_DEFER when getting=
 clocks
