Right.  IMHO you should do something to _really_ make sure that one of
the VOPs is parented on either GPLL or CPLL and then let the other VOP
be in control of VPLL.  How we actually do that is up for debate.  I
still have it on my list of things to do to look at Heiko's response
to my previous proposal, but given that I'm currently backlogged from
the two day holiday and that I'm only a few days away from a week long
vacation (and subsequent backlog), I'm not 100% sure I'll get to it
soon.  :(  I'll do my best, though...

In addition to the link Heiko gave, you could also look at
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/354165/>.  That's also
not fully baked but is another way to possibly tackle the problem.

In general if there is only one clock tree under VPLL then you
shouldn't need to worry too much about things getting out of whack.
