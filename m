The original f_init was 400k when booting up the system.

yes, I added some log and saw 100k made the initialization to work in
the resume finally with the patch applied.

Also I mentioned in the commit msg that if I just retried 400K, it
cannot made the initialization successful.

Ah, seems I should use 'max(freqs[i], host->f_min)'.. :)

I got it, thanks.
