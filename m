I was respinning too quickly. The next version will wait for this thread to
settle rather than landing on top of it.

You are right, and it is worse than that. vpcie1v8 and vpcie0v9 come from
devm_regulator_get(), not the _optional() variant, so when they are absent
from DT the core substitutes a dummy rather than failing, and
_regulator_is_enabled() returns 1 for a dummy:

	/* If we don't know then assume that the regulator is always on */
	if (!rdev->desc->ops->is_enabled)
		return 1;

Combined with my IS_ERR() checks treating an absent optional supply as
satisfied, rockchip_pcie_supplies_enabled() is unconditionally true on a
board that describes none of the four rails. The wait would then be skipped
on every such board, on resume included. That is a regression and the patch
should not go in as it stands.

The underlying mistake is that regulator_is_enabled() reports the present
state, not for how long it has held. Probe can bridge that gap: the system
has been running for seconds by then and this driver has not touched the
rails yet, so a rail that reads enabled has been enabled since boot -- and
that holds for a dummy too, since a dummy means nobody is switching it.
Resume cannot bridge it at all: the rail may have dropped and come back
microseconds ago, possibly below the regulator core's visibility.

So the next version drops the resume hunk and sets supplies_pre_enabled to
false there explicitly, leaving the full wait in place on resume. The change
then only touches probe, where the inference is sound. That also removes the
one hunk I had no measurement for: it came out of an automated review of v1,
not from hardware.

Agreed, it is counterintuitive, and I cannot explain the endpoint's
internals -- only what it does. What I can rule out is the reading your "as
long as the reset is clean" suggests, that something else happening during
the wait is the real cause. Link training is enabled just before the sleep,
so the root port spends those 100 ms training against a device held in
reset, which looked like the obvious suspect. Moving the wait to before the
link-training enable, keeping the pulse just as long, still failed 0 of 15
boots. It is the duration, not what the controller does during it.

The v3 table is one kernel with two module parameters, one sleeping before
the PERST# assertion and one in place of the msleep, and the host driver
rebound to re-run probe, so nothing varies between rows except where the
delay sits. A rebind reproduces the cold-boot failure identically, which I
checked before trusting it.

The only floor the spec gives is T_PERST, 100 us of active PERST#, and v4
started guaranteeing that explicitly with an fsleep() rather than relying on
the 100 ms. Beyond that there is no required minimum to preserve.

And the short pulse is not new behaviour: from the driver's introduction
until c47f90be4c89 in v6.11-rc1 there was no wait before the de-assert at
all, so the pulse was only as long as the register writes in between took.
That is what every endpoint on this driver saw for years. The 100 ms pulse
is the recent change, and it is what broke this one. If some device turns
out to need longer, that seems like a quirk for that device rather than a
reason to keep a default that regressed another.

Thanks for the review -- the regulator point in particular is one I would
not have found.
