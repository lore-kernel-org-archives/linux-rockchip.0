I don't understand this at all.  Are you suggesting that we need
different "pcie-reset-suspend" values based on what sort of endpoint
the user plugs in?

If so, I really don't want to get involved in that, because that's an
issue that needs to be resolved by the vendors and the PCI-SIG.  If we
put in a tweak like this, I think it would be a band-aid that only
delays getting a real solution figured out.

If you want a quirk to tune this based on specific devices, that might
make sense.  It would still sound like an interoperability issue and
an ongoing maintenance problem, but at least we would have specific
details about which devices are involved, and we'd have a chance to
make them work on more controllers than just Rockchip.
