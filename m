This is a pretty weak assurance.  Is there any stronger assurance you
can give that we're in WFI/WFE state and won't come out of it?

Do you actually see problems if you power off a CPU when it's not in
WFI/WFE state?

...so I _think_ I see the path that is happening here and what you're
trying to handle.  Specifically, I see:

On dying CPU:
1. cpu_die() calls 'complete(&cpu_died)'
2. cpu_die() calls 'smp_ops.cpu_die(cpu)' AKA rockchip_cpu_die()
3. rockchip_cpu_die() does a bit more cache flushing before looping in
cpu_do_idle()

The problem is that the moment the completion happens in step #1 above
the dying CPU can be killed.  ...so you're trying to make sure the
dying CPU makes it to cpu_do_idle().  In that case a fixed mdelay(1)
might be OK since the time that the CPU takes to run through a few
instructions (with no interrupts) is pretty predictable.  It would be
really nice if the commit message went through all this, though.

...but is there any chance that cpu_do_idle() could somehow return?
We shouldn't send any events since we've marked the core offline, but
perhaps some per-core interrupt (arch timer?) that didn't get
migrated?
