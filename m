I would recommend taking a look at the slides of the talks I gave at the
Linux Media Summit last year and this year, which should give you more
context and insight about the design choices.

- https://paulk.fr/talks/2025-linux-media-summit/2025-linux-media-summit-v4=
l2-stateless-video-encoding-uapi.pdf
- https://paulk.fr/talks/2026-linux-media-summit/2026-linux-media-summit-v4=
l2-stateless-video-encoding-uapi-progress-update.pdf

Generally speaking the idea of this proposal is to stick with the same
design idea that we had for stateless decoders, including V4L2 M2M queues,
dedicated controls and media requests.

Like Nicolas explained, some hardware can be a good fit for both
approaches. I think we agreed that it wouldn't be a problem to have two
drivers (one v4l2, one drm-ish) for the same hardware, so the question is
really about what you prefer to do and get involved with.

My V4L2-based proposal is already rather usable, although it has not yet
reached its final form. I have a GStreamer implementation ready that has
been used extensively too, but it will also need to be reworked before
it can reach upstream.

The DRM-ish proposal is at an earlier stage and will likely require a
complete redesign of your driver, moving most things in userspace.

Well there is some level of dependency to v4l2 in some places, but I'm
sure we can extract relevant parts and make them common so that a drm-ish
subsystem can reuse them easily.

In my opinion it would be fine to have two drivers, but it's really up
to you. Since you already have a v4l2 base for it, I would encourage you
to move it to my proposal, which will probably be finalized in a shorter
time frame than the other proposal and lets you reuse the code you've
already written. Then you could also add RK3576 support to the drm-ish
Vulkan Video proposal without too much work when it is ready, reusing the
RK3588 work.

But again, it's really your decision. And it's hard to say how long
things will take to finalize. But I think it would be beneficial to have
two drivers for this hardware and not trash the work you've done.

All the best,

Paul
