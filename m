Okay, I see what you mean now!

In other words:
The card expects the clock rate to increase from the current used
f_init (which is <=3D 400KHz), but still being <=3D 52MHz, when you have
set HS_TIMING to 0x1.

Okay, we can do that change! Could you try to improve the change log a
little bit or you want me to help?

Kind regards
Uffe
