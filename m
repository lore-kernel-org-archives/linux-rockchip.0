I've tested this patch together with the two clock patches linked above on a 
rk3288-firefly and a rk3288-veyron-jerry. On the firefly tuning still does not 
work (probably really some regulator issue) and on veyron tuning still works 
as expected, so

Doug's explanations both in the commit message and the code look sane to me, 
but I don't feel confident enough in my understanding of the matter to 
transform that into a Reviewed-by tag.
