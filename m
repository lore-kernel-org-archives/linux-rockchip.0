Except... we don't generally model connectors under DRM as a general
rule.  (The fbdev video connector stuff happened without very much
publicity afaics.)

It's not always appropriate to split it out from the bridge in any
case.  Consider something like a TDA998x where the TDA998x itself
takes care of reading the DDC bus, and doesn't provide an I2C-like
interface.  If you try and split that into "bridge" or "encoder" and
"connector" you end up having to invent a new kind of I2C thing which
isn't an I2C adapter, or somehow squeezing an I2C adapter which isn't
into the I2C layer.

The TDA998x provides an interface to read a block of EDID at a time.
It always does the page register access.  You don't get to read it
byte wise.  It doesn't fit into I2C as an adapter at all.
