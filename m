Right - unless we have a possibility to re-route the SDIO irq line to
GPIO irq for wake-up when the controller enters low power state.

I wonder whether this is related to SDIO IRQs but not generic to SDIO.

For example, when we have a WIFI chip with a dedicated and separate
IRQ line, enabling SDMMC_CLKEN_LOW_PWR could make sense.

Thanks for the detailed clarification.

I understand this "quick" fix in dw_mmc takes care of the problem.
However, allow me to try to make this a bit more generic. I intend to
post something within a few days. If I fail, let's go with this
solution.

Kind regards
