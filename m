I don't think so, I think we didn't need add the for trip_high.

We should triggle the trip points () in time when passive cooling,
and throttle the frequency with the related governor. (After all that's=
=20
used for high temperature)

Maybe, we should think about the low temperature for thermal. (e.g. -10=
=20
degree, -20 degree....)
The rockchip some SoCs have the hardware low temperature interrupts for=
=20
thermal,
but I haven't got up it.

Okay, I agree with you in here. :)
