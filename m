What you're recommending is to basically ignore the published workaround,
which, presumably, was arrived at by proper analysis of the issue both
by Freescale engineers and Synopsys engineers, and instead try some other
solution.

I'm not sure that's a good idea.  Only those with knowledge of the IP can
say what effect disabling the audio clock will have: will it still allow
the FIFO to be loaded, as required by the errata?  If not, it's not a
solution that AHB can use.  I would imagine that _if_ it was as simple as
disabling the audio clock, that simple approach would have been documented
in Freescale's errata documents, rather than the rather more complex
method of zeroing the CTS/N values.

I think there are two choices here:

1) get some definitive information about the IP and the errata for AHB,
   and determine whether the solution you propose would work.  (That's
   out of scope for me, I've no contacts with FSL/NXP and I'm not a
   Synopsys customer.)

2) the I2S audio support stops re-using the AHB audio support functions,
   switching to their own implementation that behaves correctly for them.
   (Remember, it was I2S's choice to re-use the AHB audio support functions
   I added which we're now discussing - they didn't have to do that, and
   regressing AHB audio just for I2S is not something we should ever
   consider doing.)
