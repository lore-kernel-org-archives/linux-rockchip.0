Yeah, unless you somehow knew that your card would only have one function.

Right.  Unplugging / re-plugging is sorta gross / inelegant, but it is
definitely simpler and nice that it doesn't add so many new code
paths.  For cases where you're just trying to re-init things with a
hammer it works pretty well.

If you don't mind, that would probably be easiest.  I've totally
swapped out all of the implementation details of this from my brain
now, but if I saw a patch from you it would be easy for me to analyze
it and test it.

Thanks!
