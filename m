Sounds like we need a confirmation from some hardware people on
this if the PCI device WAKE# can be wired to PCI controller or
to a separate PM controller directly :)

If a PCI device has it's WAKE# wired directly to a PM controller
instead of the PCI controller, then it seems that the PCI controller
should be woken up and then presumably the regular PCI device
interrupts will take care of the rest.

Or else I'd say if the driver for the PCI device in some custom
case needs to do something specific, then having that driver
implement PM runtime makes sense. Naturally we want to avoid a
dependency where all the possible drivers would need to implement
PM runtime, I doubt that's needed though.
