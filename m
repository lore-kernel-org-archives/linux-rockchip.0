You are comparing apples and oranges.

stdout-path defines which output device is the "standard output", but
it doesn't define that it shall be called "output device number zero".

So, stdout-path has nothing to do with device naming.

Right, you probably only have the usdhc2 and usdhc3 devices enabled
in device tree, and usdhc2 gets probed first (and allocated the first
MMC host index) followed by usdhc3.

Prior to the commit I mentioned, your case would have been quite sane
in that the SD card would always show up as mmcblk0 irrespective of
the order that the two SD host interfaces were discovered.  However,
the commit that ties the MMC/SD host number to the MMC block device
number has two effects:

1. the MMC block device numbers are equal to the MMC/SD host numbers.
2. the MMC standard supports multiple cards attached to a single host
   which became unsupportable.  (This is why MMC block device numbers
   were dynamic - the MMC code was written in the days when MMC cards
   were popular and SD was "new".  There is no way to really know how
   many MMC block devices there could be showing up per host.)  That
   became obsolete with SD, and I don't believe anyone ever produced
   a multi-MMC card setup.

I had realised that setups such as yours (SDIO in first host, SD in
second host) would result in a sane numbering becoming weird, but the
voices demanding (and I use demand, because that's exactly the tone
of the discussion) that MMC block devices not be dynamic were very
loud and strong - and remains so, as you can see from the tone of
Mans message bring this subject back up.

I should point out that as a result of this, MMC block devices follow
different behaviour from other devices in Linux.  For example:

- ATA HDDs devices get allocated SCSI disk numbers starting at zero
  according to the order they are detected.  The same goes for all
  other devices such as scanners, tape drives, optical drives, etc.
- Ethernet devices get allocated ethX numbers starting at zero
  according to the order that the drivers register the devices.
- USB devices are exactly the same - entirely dynamic device names.

For all of these, there are solutions in userspace.  For block devices
with partitions, there is PARTUUID, which is an identifier from the
partition table plus a partition number which the kernel can interpret.
There are filesystem labels and UUIDs which an initramfs can probe to
locate the root filesystem.  These can also be used with udev to
create persistent device names in /dev - see /dev/disk/by-* for
example.

Ethernet devices in modern distros have udev rules to rename them to
a name that somehow represents their location - eg, enp1s0.

USB devices, such as serial ports, do not have static names, but if
you have a lot of them (like I do) udev really helps - I have custom
udev rules which create symlinks to the USB serial devices I care
about in /dev/serial, so for example:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 20 00:43 /dev/serial/usb-cubox-es -> ../ttyUSB0
...
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Mar 20 00:43 /dev/serial/usb-mcbin-ds-es -> ../ttyUSB10
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Mar 20 00:43 /dev/serial/usb-mcbin-ss -> ../ttyUSB11
...
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 20 00:43 /dev/serial/usb-ttl -> ../ttyUSB1
...
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 20 00:43 /dev/serial/usb-zii-b -> ../ttyUSB8

so I no longer need to worry about which order these are discovered,
which bus they're connected to, which hub, or anything, which is
kind of important when you consider that this machine is laptop on a
docking station, and all these devices are connected via hubs on
four USB ports on the docking station.

In the absence of such custom rules, there are persistent names by
both the device name/serial number (/dev/serial/by-id) and by the
bus path (/dev/serial/by-path).  Both of these are created by udev
using the policy set in its rules database.

The kernel really does not set the userspace device name policy,
although it has a "default" policy.  Userspace has, for many years,
been at liberty to change the policy in any way it sees fit, even if
devtmpfs is being used.

devtmpfs is just a tmpfs filesystem which the kernel adds devices
to using the kernel's naming policy, and will remove its own 
devices when they disappear.  Userspace is at liberty to create
additional names, rename the devices, even delete them if it so
wishes.

Sure, some people may not wish to run udev, which is fine.  In the
absence of udev, it is entirely possible to find out the device
names by looking in /sys/class or /sys/devices.  For example, on
my Armada 8040 platform (where I have eMMC and a SD card), I can
look at all the block devices present using the default kernel
device name:

$ ls -al /sys/class/block

and each one is a symlink (that can be read using readlink in shell
code) to discover where it is on the system.  For example, in bash:

for dev in /sys/class/block/mmcblk*; do
  path=`readlink -f $dev`
  if [[ $path =~ /f06e0000.sdhci/ ]]; then
     basename $dev
  fi
done

yields:

mmcblk0
mmcblk0boot0
mmcblk0boot1

which are found under /dev:

brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179,  0 Mar 26 19:30 /dev/mmcblk0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179,  8 Mar 26 19:30 /dev/mmcblk0boot0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179, 16 Mar 26 19:30 /dev/mmcblk0boot1

Here's another way, which is simpler if you have the path of the
device in DT, which will always be constant:

$ basename
/sys/devices/platform/ap806/ap806\:config-space@f0000000/f06e0000.sdhci/mmc_host/mmc*/mmc*/block/mmcblk*
mmcblk0

or if you prefer:

$ find /sys/devices/platform/ap806/ap806\:config-space@f0000000/f06e0000.sdhci -name 'mmcblk?' -printf '%f\n'
mmcblk0

or:

$ find /sys/devices/platform/ap806 -name 'mmcblk*' -printf '%f\n'
mmcblk0rpmb
mmcblk0
mmcblk0boot0
mmcblk0boot1
$ find /sys/devices/platform/cp0 -name 'mmcblk*' -printf '%f\n'
mmcblk1
mmcblk1p3
mmcblk1p1
mmcblk1p2

There are many ways to solve the "what name is my device using" problem
in userspace that does not require coding policy into the kernel.
