I don't understand this either.  I'd think the best solution is
simple-card, configured through DTS for each device.

The issue I was referring to when I spoke with rock chip was the need
to pass the jack simple-card creates to the headset chip or codec.  We
need a way to specify a device like a tsa227e or rt5650 to pass the
jack to, which events are supported by the jack, and a generic API for
passing the jack.
