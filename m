This should be sorted alphabetically.  Thus this should sort right
after this in rk3288-veyron.dtsi

&gpu {
  mali-supply = <&vdd_gpu>;
  status = "okay";
};

Also you don't need to replicate the whole structure?  I think the
above should just be:

&gpu_alert0 {
  temperature = <72500>; /* millicelsius */
};

NOTE also that that gpu and cpu critical is 100 C downstream.  Should
we do that too?  Ah, but before we do that I guess we'd need to also
override the "rockchip,hw-tshut-temp" to 125000 to match downstream.
I guess that could be a separate series?
