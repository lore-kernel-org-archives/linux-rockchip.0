This are two orthogonal things. The "should pwm_apply_state change the
state argument" isn't really comparable to the clk stuff, as there only
the frequency is provided that is passed by value, not by reference as
the PWM state.

The key argument for me to *not* change it is that it might yield
surprises, still more as today most drivers don't adapt. An -- I admit
constructed, not real-word -- case where adaption would go wrong is:

	pwm_apply_state(pwm1, &mystate);
	pwm_apply_state(pwm2, &mystate);

I don't see what you mean here. I don't see any adaption.

It depends on the use case. For one of them I suggested an algorithm.

Yeah, something like that would be good. Still for the device drivers I
would use the callback I suggested because that is easier to implement.
This way the complexity is once in the framework instead of in each
driver.
