Well, the retry-count is a maximum number of retries to detect a status cha=
nge
on external power connection/disconnection. From my experience, it seems th=
at
nyans do indeed more retries to detect the change than veyrons, on average.

I don't think setting this value to 1 is very reasonable (in the end, that'=
s a
number of seconds), because power supply status changes tend to take a few
seconds to reflect on the battery status.

I think setting a high value (like 10) would always work and either way, th=
e
status detection mechanism stops itself as soon as a change is detected (it
turns out this is not a good idea for bq27xxx batteries, because they go fr=
om
charging to full in the first seconds after AC connection instead of direct=
ly
reporting full, when full), but let's assume this is okay for sbs (and mayb=
e
change it later).

That's true, but I think it makes as much sense to keep the whole binding.

In my opinion, the only reason to have a separate dtsi for this binding is =
that
veyrons have another dtsi for chromebooks where this binding should be. How=
ever,
it cannot be there because of minnie using another battery IC.

So my approach here would be to make it common for devices where other majo=
r
parts are also common, so we can avoid duplication when most of the device-=
tree
is already common. In cases where most of the device-tree is specific to a
device, I think the binding should be duplicated. This is done already for =
lots
of other components that could be made (somewhat) common anyway.

Thanks for taking that choice, it indeed makes things easier on the kernel =
side
whith no drawbacks.

I definitely agree. I think copies are a good fit here because overall, we =
have
enough disparity in the possible configurations among different SoC platfor=
ms to
justify having one per device. So I believe it would make sense to make tha=
t
binding common *among the same SoC family*.
