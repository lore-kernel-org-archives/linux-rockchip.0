And this means you have bug in some of I2C client drivers which do not stop
their activities during suspend properly (most usual case - driver uses work
and this work still active during suspend and can run on one CPU while suspend
runs on another).

At the moment .suspend_noirq() callback is called there should be no active
I2C transactions in general.

You need to catch and fix all driver who will try to access I2C after your
I2C bus driver passes suspend_noirq stage. Smth, like [1], uses i2c_lock_adapter().
