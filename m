Hmmm, sorry, I misinterpreted both 1/4 and 2/4.  I read them as "add
this delay so the PLEXTOR device works", but in fact, I think in both
cases, the delay is actually to enforce the PCIe r6.0, sec 6.6.1,
requirement for software to wait 100ms before issuing a config
request, and the fact that it makes PLEXTOR work is a side effect of
that.

The beginning of that 100ms delay is "exit from Conventional Reset"
(ports that support <= 5.0 GT/s) or "link training completes" (ports
that support > 5.0 GT/s).

I think we lack that 100ms delay in dwc drivers in general.  The only
generic dwc delay is in dw_pcie_host_init() via the LINK_WAIT_SLEEP_MS
in dw_pcie_wait_for_link(), but that doesn't count because it's
*before* the link comes up.  We have to wait 100ms *after* exiting
Conventional Reset or completing link training.  

We don't know when the exit from Conventional Reset was, but it was
certainly before the link came up.  In the absence of a timestamp for
exit from reset, starting the wait after link-up is probably the best
we can do.  This could be either after dw_pcie_wait_for_link() finds
the link up or when we handle the link-up interrupt.

Patches 1 and 2 would fix the link-up interrupt case.  I think we need
another patch for the dwc core for dw_pcie_wait_for_link().

I wish I'd had time to spend on this and include patches 1 and 2, but
we're up against the merge window wire and I'll be out the end of this
week, so I think they'll have to wait.  It seems like something we can
still justify for v6.16 though.

This also means I don't think we should need an NVMe quirk.
