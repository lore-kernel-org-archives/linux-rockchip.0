Looking at the code, I don't think this statement is entirely true.
Isn't it so that we will be trying with a maximum tolerance of 0.3 V
towards the VMMC voltage level (then fall-back to the complete range)?
Perhaps you can find a better way to describe that in the change log.

Just to be clear, I believe this approach make sense but I appreciate
some more details about the policy, both in the code and in the change
log.

In general vqmmc is considered as an optional regulator and that's
also how host drivers treat it. So perhaps it would make sense to
return 0 here instead of an error code or what do you think?

Before invoking regulator_get_voltage(), we need to check for an
existing regulator handle for vmmc.

Moreover, as the regulator handle to vmmc is optional, perhaps we
should fall-back to use the ios->vdd bit to find the current voltage
level?

These calculations deserves a comment.

According to my upper comment about vqmmc being optional, perhaps this
shouldn't be treated as an error!?

Finally, I wonder if you have considered to handle the
regulator_enable|disable() calls from within this new API? Currently
host driver deals with that themselves, but it would be nice to get
some consolidation around that. Similar to what we already have for
the vmmc regulator through the mmc_regulator_set_ocr() API.

If you considered this, I am fine with adding that kind of
functionality as a separate patch on top of this one, it gets easier
to discuss/review.

Kind regards
Uffe
