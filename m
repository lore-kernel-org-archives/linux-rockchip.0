And to clarify, review of patches is very much appreciated, but to be
effective it should be top down. First assess whether it's a good idea,
then whether the implementation makes sense, then go down into style
naming and details like that. And it's important to tell the submitter
where they are in that process, too. More in-depth writeup of a good
review approach:
