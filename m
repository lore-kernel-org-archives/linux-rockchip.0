Right, let me add some context. rk3576.dtsi/rk3588-base.dtsi became a user =
of
the binding in 7.0-rc1, which is a pre-release. In fact, I initially though=
t the
bindings was merged at the same time, which Krzysztof highlighted as my mis=
take.
And the driver modification that utilize multiple reg ranges was also intro=
duced
in 7.0-rc1. More clarification on that below.

Ack, I'm not the one doing the work (just a reviewer), but was involved in
picking the work, and trying to learn enough so I can perhaps catch this ne=
xt
time.

I think from the above analyses, since the usage only starts in rc1, we hav=
e
room for improving it knowing we aren't creating problem for anyone. Note t=
hat I
have no idea what the syntax is to "do this", and I doubt either Detlev or
Cristian have a clue.

That forced me to check the driver. So for RK33xx and older, there is only =
one
range, and the driver will just pick the one entry expected:


	if (rkvdec->variant->has_single_reg_region) {
		rkvdec->regs =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->regs))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->regs);
	} else {
		rkvdec->regs =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(pdev, "function");
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->regs))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->regs);

		rkvdec->link =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(pdev, "link");
		if (IS_ERR(rkvdec->link))
			return PTR_ERR(rkvdec->link);
	}


Where for RK35xx variants, it only pick the resources by name. I don't see =
the
bug that you see, but I believe this was just a supposition, that you didn'=
t
check the code.

So what happened with the binding, is that in preparation for the new SoC, =
they
added the named range, but probably without really realizing that there was=
 an
ordering imposed, or realizing the order was far from ideal.

Understood, I think Cristian is a bit sandwich between my rational to make
things match the doc, and Krzysztof requesting to preserve the ABI. I think
that's fixable, but again, if there is a syntax to just remove the ordering=
 from
there, knowing there is no user of that order in released kernel yet, that =
would
be my preference over deprecation syntax.

Nicolas
