Ah!  I added that message to the top of my upstream series and,
indeed, I sometimes see the PHY fail to turn on.  Doh.

OK, so here's what I've done:

* The place where I ran the overnight loops was actually the Chrome OS
4.4 kernel.  In that kernel I had a message very similar to yours and
I didn't hit it.  I just re-ran this for 20 minutes now and I can
re-confirm.  In the Chrome OS kernel I never see it needing more than
a 1 (or 2) loops and it doesn't ever get into the "totally failed"
case.

* Previously I ran ~10 minutes with the upstream kernel, but at the
time I didn't have your printout.  After 10 minutes I checked my logs
and I definitely saw the "Needed 1 loops to turn on", so I knew my
patch was doing something useful.  It didn't occur to me to re-confirm
that I didn't get the "totally failed" upstream, though now that I say
it out loud it's stupid that I didn't think to do this.

* Previously when playing with patches on the upstream kernel I saw
lots of problems powering on the PHY and I thought my patch was
helping, but that was all very non-scientific.


So to say it shortly:

* For me, my patch makes things a slightly better even on the upstream
kernel (I do sometimes see the "turned on after 1 tries")

* I can confirm that my patch doesn't fix everything upstream, so
there's something different about the Chrome OS tree still.

---

I also picked all the local patches from the Chrome OS kernel to the
PHY driver and now my PHY driver in the upstream and downstream trees
match.  I can still reproduce problems.  So the issue is somewhere at
a higher level...


So basically something outside the PHY driver is causing it to fail
unexpectedly upstream.  I guess the hacky retry won't work well enough
there after all.  :(

One question: if you get the "failed after 100 loops" and then you do
another unbind / bind, does it work after that?  The original reason I
got the idea to retry was because if I simply tried an unbind / bind
again then things worked OK...
