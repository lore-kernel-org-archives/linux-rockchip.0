I'm glad to hear that you find buffer handling easy in V4L2 :-)

CC'ing Alexandre Courbot. Alex, how's the request API going ? :-)

So the device performs bi-directional DMA on the capture queue buffers =

Interesting, does videobuf2 support that properly ?

You might want to explain this in the code, otherwise someone will ask =
you why=20
you don't implement support for the MMU through the IOMMU API. Calling =
it=20
scatter-gather would solve that problem, but if the hardware manual cal=
ls it=20
an MMU, there's no reason not to use that name in the code.
