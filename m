This is right, hence:

...you will slightly break bisectability with this series though,
right?  In the previous patch in this series you changed the clocks in
the mux away from the fake ones to be the real ones.  If you have
either that patch without this one or this patch without that one then
clock parents won't get assigned properly...

I seem to remember that one of the USB phy clocks was kinds jittery (I
want to say it was the EHCI one) and that was causing problems talking
to the BT UART at 3Mbps.  I kinda doubt we have anyone running BT on
upstream over that UART (only used on veyron devices with Broadcom
WiFi), so maybe this is OK.  ...but if you had any other ideas for how
to avoid breaking bisect that would be nice.

If nothing else, if we're going to break bisect then the two commits
should reference each other and say that you need both and that with
only one you might see a different clock selected...
