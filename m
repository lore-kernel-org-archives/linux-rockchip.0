Is it related with PWREN register?
I'm checking the TRM for PWREN register..

"Optional feature; ports can be used as general-purpose outputs."

Does it use the ports as GPIO?

I'm not sure that it's right that add the gpio power control into mmc core.
slot-gpio? i think it can use the regulator framework with gpio.
I don't have a lot knowledge of power, but it might be controlled whether active is low or high.
So i think it doesn't need to add for entire mmc controller.
