Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below a pull request for rockchip-related clock changes for 4.10.
Nothing really big stands out this time, so if it looks ok please pull.


Thanks
Heiko

  clk: rockchip: Ignore frac divisor for PLL equivalence when it's unused (2016-11-05 23:16:29 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
PLL initialization for PLLs having both an integral and fractional mode
(rk3036, rk3399) does now take into account the mode that the PLL is
actually running at.
As always also some additional and optimized PLL rates for rk3066 and
rk3399, some additional clock ids for rk3066 and some additional clocks
on rk3399 are now sucessfully handled inside their respective driver.

      Merge branch 'v4.10-shared/clkids' into v4.10-clk/next

Jianqun Xu (1):
      clk: rockchip: remove more CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED for rk3399 clocktree

Julius Werner (1):
      clk: rockchip: Ignore frac divisor for PLL equivalence when it's unused

Paweł Jarosz (3):
      clk: rockchip: Add binding ids for cpu and peri clocks on rk3066
      clk: rockchip: Use clock ids for cpu and peri clocks on rk3066
      clk: rockchip: add 400MHz to rk3066 clock rates table

Xing Zheng (2):
      clk: rockchip: add 533.25MHz to rk3399 clock rates table
      clk: rockchip: optimize 800MHz and 1GHz pll rates on RK3399
