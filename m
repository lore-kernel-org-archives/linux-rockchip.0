I do not think it is, could possible be to keep power consumption at
minimum while decoding. Some parts enable auto gating and then we
disable it when decoding is complete. With auto-suspend the entire block
is disabled anyway so this probably did not make any noticeable
difference and could instead introduce new possible issues.

The format selection in kernel for this series should be correct,
however to ensure 10-bit works you need following for ffmpeg-v4l2request
to select and use 10-bit pixel formats:

libdrm 2.4.104+ (NV15) / 2.4.118+ (NV20)
- 10-bit drm formats, ffmpeg v4l2request test with a #ifdef

linux headers v6.16-rc1+ (NV15/NV20)
- 10-bit v4l2 pix fmt, ffmpeg v4l2request test with a #ifdef

FFmpeg v4l2request will not negotiate use of 10-bit formats without
DRM_FORMAT_NV15/NV20 and V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV15/NV20 defined when ffmpeg was
compiled.

That would be the most likely issue if only 8-bit formats is working.

Looking quickly at the 'fix 8/10-bit selection' commit the issue is that
rkvdec_hevc_get_image_fmt() was incomplete to begin with. The
rkvdec_hevc_get_image_fmt() in this series has been correct since v1.

Yes, adding proper HW reset support is something for a future series.
