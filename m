Maybe a third opinion could make this conversation constructive again.

I think Doug's point is that using a UUID or labels for consistency is
orthogonal to having a deterministic numbering for MMC devices. And I
agree with his point of view for what is worth.

I understand that this not true for other systems and peripherals but
in the specific case of MMC, the changes are minimal as Doug's patches
have shown and even the technical manual of SoCs has an enumeration to
refer each SD/MMC slot.

So I think is fair to say that SD/MMC is different than say USB mass
storage devices as you mentioned, and having a consistent numbering is
very helpful for diagnostics and debugging purposes IMHO.

BTW, I use labels in all my systems because as you said it's nice to
be able to swap cards and not change the bootloader env vars, but I
see how having a deterministic numbering could be useful to others.

Best regards,
Javier
