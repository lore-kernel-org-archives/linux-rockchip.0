There are several similar errata on Cortex A12 and A17 that all have the
same workaround: setting bit[12] of the Feature Register.  Technically
the list of errata are:

- A12 818325: Execution of an UNPREDICTABLE STR or STM instruction might
  deadlock.  Fixed in r0p1.
- A12 852422: Execution of a sequence of instructions might lead to
  either a data corruption or a CPU deadlock.  Not fixed in any A12s
  yet.
- A17 852423: Execution of a sequence of instructions might lead to
  either a data corruption or a CPU deadlock.  Not fixed in any A17s
  yet.

Since A12 got renamed to A17 it seems likely that there won't be any
future Cortex-A12 cores, so we'll enable for all Cortex-A12.

For Cortex-A17 I believe that all known revisions are affected and that
all knows revisions means <= r1p2.  Presumably if a new A17 was released
it would have this problem fixed.

Note that in <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4735341/> folks
previously expressed opposition to this change because:
A) It was thought to only apply to r0p0 and there were no known r0p0
   boards supported in mainline.
B) It was argued that such a workaround beloned in firmware.

Now that this same fix solves other errata on real boards (like rk3288)
point A) is addressed.

Point B) is impossible to address on boards like rk3288.  On rk3288 the
firmware doesn't stay resident in RAM and isn't involved at all in the
suspend/resume process nor in the SMP bringup process.  That means that
the most the firmware could do would be to set the bit on "core 0" and
this bit would be lost at suspend/resume time.  It is true that we could
write a "generic" solution that saved the boot-time "core 0" value of
this register and applied it at SMP bringup / resume time.  However,
since this register (described as the "Feature Register" in errata)
appears to be undocumented (as far as I can tell) and is only modified
for these errata, that "generic" solution seems questionably cleaner.
The generic solution also won't fix existing users that haven't happened
to do a FW update.

Note that in ARM64 presumably PSCI will be universal and fixes like this
will end up in ATF.  Hopefully we are nearing the end of this style of
errata workaround.
