Is 1V the lowest possible value? How did you get to that?

Why 3V? Shouldn't it be 2.7V? How will else those SoC that for example
supports 2.9V only work?

One more thought,s as for the vmmc regulator we have a
"regulator_enabled" member in the mmc_host. Should we add a similar
member for vqmmc? That would prevent host drivers from keeping track
of this state themselves.

Kind regards
