No. The kernel only depends on PSCI. Anyone can implement PSCI firmware
through
OPTEE/Trusty/U-Boot/UEFI or other open source implementation. We don't limit
people use vendor software or not. As Frank said, we will open source
OPTEE which
support PSCI for our chips.
BTW people can implement SMP/suspend function builtin in kernel as
usual. We just
hope use PSCI by default, so we can support TEE more easy as arm64.
