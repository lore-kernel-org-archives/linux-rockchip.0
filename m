Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below clock changes for 4.8.

Apart from some new clock ids there is the addition of a placeholder clock
for the rk3399 watchdog pclk - as explained in the code, this gate is not
controlled through the clock controller but through the general register
files, yet the watchdog is unhappy if can't see the clock. And finally some
small fixes for clock mistakes that do not affect any currently support
board ip blocks like spdif-DPTX clock on the rk3399.

So if this looks ok, please pull

Thanks
Heiko
