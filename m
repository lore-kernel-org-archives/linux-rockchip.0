rk3188 specific. Applies also for rk3288 AFAICT. Without entering in the
details, the SoC can't handle that.

Nope, rockchip clockevents won't be used, smp_twd will instead.

You can check by commenting the local-timer in the DT, and you should see the
/proc/interrupts line for the rockchip incrementing while the 'twd' are zero.

No, actually I meant the rockchip clockevents won't be used for both rk3188 and
rk3288, they are not needed.

It is for information, this patch is ok.
