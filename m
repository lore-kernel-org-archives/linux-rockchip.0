Hi Heiko,

Thank you for your feedback! Initially, MHDP driver was developed as a DRM =
bridge driver and was planned to be placed in drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/cadenc=
e/mhdp.c.  However, there was already a driver for Cadence's DP controller =
developed by RockChip, but that driver uses different DRM framework. Both c=
ontrollers (including firmware) are quite different internally (MST/FEC/DSC=
 support, link training done by driver, additional commands, etc.) but they=
 have very similar register map, except for Framer/Streamer, so they appear=
 similar.

We would be more than happy to provide fully separate driver (that was basi=
cally pasted in RockChip's driver) for DP DRM bridge. Some parts can defini=
tely shared between these two drivers like code for mailbox and commands se=
nt/received by it, audio init.

Moving cdn-dp-* to drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ was also a plan, but it seems th=
at cdn-dp-core.c use some stuff from drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/*. cdn-dp-cor=
e driver in this case seems like a part of a bigger picture while the drive=
r that we want to upstream is standalone.

We'll move/add everything that can be shared by both drivers to drivers/gpu=
/drm/ and add new DPI/DP bridge driver as you advised and provide a new pat=
ch.

PS. Should we post patches 01-08 done in DRM helper by Quentin as a separat=
e patch, so that reviewers will not have to go through them every time when=
 we send updated version?

Regards,
Damian

Hi Damien,

it's very cool to see collaboration from vendors on this.

From the changes below, it looks that this seems to add support for a bridg=
e chip based on that IP block. So it seems like the bridge+glue driver mode=
l would be a perfect fit for this, instead of stapling this onto the Rockch=
ip-specific driver.

So essentially, you could take the Rockchip cdn-dp driver, move the common =
parts to drivers/gpu/drm/bridge and then create separate glue drivers for b=
oth Rockchip and your external bridge IP block.

This would prevent code duplication and also allow your bridge driver to be=
 compiled without the Rockchip drm being present :-) .
And also pave the way for future socs using your DP ip block.


Nowadays we have quite a number of examples you could take as inspiration f=
or this:
- bridge/analogix/* (shared between Exynos and Rockchip right now)
- bridge/synopsys/dw-hdmi* (shared between a quite big number of users)
- bridge/synopsys/dw-mipi-dsi.c (shared between Rockchip [pending] and stm)


Thanks
Heiko
