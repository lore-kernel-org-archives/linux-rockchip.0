can you check against which compatibles that coreboot really matches?

As we said that the evb changed between rev1 and rev2, I would expect the 
compatible to be something like

	compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-evb",  "google,rk3399evb-rev2", 
			"rockchip,rk3399";

leaving out the rev1 and rev0

Can you check if this runs stable with the pwm-regulator in mainline please?
I.e. Boris' rework series hasn't landed yet and at least on Veyron I remember 
the pwm-regulator having reliability issues or something like that.
