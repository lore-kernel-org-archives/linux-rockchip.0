sorry, about that falling so far down my inbox. I'll try to look at it today 
or tomorrow.

But overall it looks good.

@David: if you wake up before I manage to review more in-depth, the
"reading register twice" (+writing counterpart)
+                       /* need to read regs twice */
+                       ret = regmap_read(regmap, reg, &temp);
+                       if (ret)
+                               return ret;

should definitly get more explanation on how that access scheme works. Seems to 
be some special register access method with the register returning different 
values each time? As I don't have a manual for the soc yet this is definitly 
curious for me :-)
