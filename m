I tried a similar mechanism for dw_mmc and it mostly worked.  Until I
stressed it out.  I stressed it out by running:

while true; do
  ifconfig mlan0 up;
  ifconfig mlan0 down;
done

When I did this long enough, I somehow managed to get into a state
where the card allowed itself to temporarily be runtime suspended.
This caused communication errors and eventually the mwifiex driver did
a full reset of itself.  I found that when communication errors were
happening that I was runtime suspended.

For whatever reason this was easiest to reproduce when I added a
printk to a serial console in the enable_sdio_irq() callback, but I
could also reproduce by setting the autosuspend_delay_ms to 1 and
using pm_runtime_put() instead of pm_runtime_put_noidle() in my patch.


It looks like on dw_mmc enable_sdio_irq(0) enable_sdio_irq(1) is
called almost constantly.  Without having boards with SDHCI and SDIO
to test with, it appears that this is different than how things work
with SDHCI.  For dw_mmc enable/disable is called in sdio_irq_thread()
to mask new interrupts while processing the current one.  SDHCI
doesn't use sdio_irq_thread() because it sets
MMC_CAP2_SDIO_IRQ_NOTHREAD.

Because of this constant stream of disable / enable calls we spend
some amount of time with Runtime PM enabled.  If we happen to have
enough delays (or printks) and we happen to get lucky then we can end
up running the PM Runtime suspend code for dw_mmc.  This is bad
because dw_mci_runtime_resume() fully resets the host controller and
clears all interrupts.  That doesn't seem so great, but I believe the
specific problem is that we might be clearing the next SDIO interrupt
which might have already come in (I haven't proven this).

Overall we really just don't want any Runtime PM at all when SDIO
Interrupts are being used.  There's currently no callback into dw_mmc
that gets called when someone holds a SDIO IRQ.  I suppose we could
add one from sdio_claim_irq() / sdio_release_irq() if that was
desired...


We could also (in theory) get the core SDIO code to get / put Runtime
PM whenever it's currently processing an interrupt.  I coded this up
and I can post it if you want, but it feels a bit complicated.


Instead I'm thinking of using the same solution I came up with for
DW_MMC_CARD_NO_LOW_PWR in dw_mmc: putting this in dw_mci_init_card().
It's not 100% perfect if there are use cases where the SDIO interrupt
is really disabled for long periods of times (and we want to save
power) but seems like a good stopgap and eliminates this particular
regression quickly.

OK, I've posted that now.  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9676197/

Whew, that took a lot longer to dig into than I originally thought it
would.  :-P

Ah, good point.  I hadn't thought about the shared power domain case.
