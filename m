(I'm sure there may be problems with the above series. We probably
should give it another shot though someday, as I think it's closer to
the mark.)

I think you've conflated INTx with WAKE# just a bit (and to be fair,
that's exactly what the bad binding we're trying to replace did,
accidentally). We're not trying to claim this WAKE# signal replaces the
typical PCI interrupts, but it *is* an interrupt in some sense --
"depending on your definition of interrupt", per our IRC conversation ;)

So I think Mark Rutland already shot that one down; it's conceptually an
interrupt from the device's perspective. We just need to figure out a
good way of representing it that doesn't stomp on the existing INTx
definitions.
