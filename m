Well, and that actually brings related question "how do you format the
right USB stick if you have 5 of them connected". PCs don't have good
solution, but that does not mean it can't be solved.

And no, its not really the same. At least in N900 case, I'm not really
sure if you are expected to manipulate the u-SD card while the system
is on. It is under battery cover.

Yes, labels would be nice. Plus the slot numbers should be stable, so
that booting does not randomly break.
