Your "Signed-off-by"s are a little wonky here...  Can you fix up?

I am a little curious why you need to change the readl_relaxed() to a
read().  Are you trying to ensure that the clock was on before the
read happened?  If so, I think this won't help.  I see:

#define readl(c) ({ u32 __v = readl_relaxed(c); __iormb(); __v; })

...so that means that the iormb() is _after_ the readl.

...but I would believe that the clk_enable() call itself would be
guaranteeing that the clock was enabled in time.  ...and if not then
grabbing the spinlock is another barrier, right?  I think you do this
in a few places...

Other than that this patch looks good to me....
