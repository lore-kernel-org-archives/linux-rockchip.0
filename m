It looks like Thomas' SPDX documentation patches are not yet merged
and there were smaller protests about SPDX information only being
available on some external website, so just for my understanding, SPDX
is the agreed standard now, right?

And judging by the SPDX conversion for Rockchip dts I have in my inbox
the correct tags should probably be
	// SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0+ OR MIT)

due to the
"All devicetrees claim to be either GPL or X11 while the actual license
text is MIT. Therefore we use MIT for the SPDX tag as X11 is clearly
wrong."

yep, that's correct. Most newer Rockchip socs drive the debug uart
with 1.5MBps as default these days.

The driver binds against the node names including the underscores.
