Hrm, right.  The PWM ought to own the pinctrl, not the regulator.
Hrm.  Then I guess this gets more complicated.

One thing to point out, though, is that an EE I talked to said that
the "voltage when input" is actually a well defined property and is
unrelated to the min/max voltage.  AKA: it's not guaranteed to be
equal to the 50% duty cycle.  ...so adding a property to the PWM
regulator that includes this value is something very sane.  The
"voltage when input" is defined by the pile of resistors and
capacitors that are used to actually make the PWM control the
regulator.

The "voltage when input" is super important because this is the
voltage that's used at bootup (when all pins are configured as inputs,
possible with a pull applied) and that's used during suspend time when
the PWM stops.
