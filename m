researching a bit myself it seems you're right here. It would be nice t=

mention this in the commit log though.

Hmm, probably that's overkill. (Better spend the time fixing printk not
to disable irqs that long :-)

If you rework your commit log to describe the failing situation more
accurately that should be fine.
