I've now had a chance to look at that reload board on the firefly site.
Firefly also is the company name, so a board named that way is not 
necessarily a "variant" :-) .

And looking at the "reload" board this definitly seems to be a very 
different product with it being a system-on-module+baseboard design with 
additional peripherals like that sata bridge, camera interfaces and probably 
more.

As you might've seen, most Rockchip boards are based on some reference-
design, so are similar in a big part of their core layout.
So, looking at the vastly different product the reload is, I'd really like 
to have a separate dts for the reload, to not run into more confusing 
differences later on.

Also, when adding a new board, please also add an entry to 
Documentation/devicetree/bindingd/arm/rockchip.txt


Thanks
Heiko
