Maybe, Only I can say that the panels I checked always first enable
the PWM and then set the ENABLE signal, but of course I didn't check
all the panels.

Would be more acceptable have enable-delay-us and disable-delay-us proprieties?

To be honest I'm also not sure why is required the post delay, some
panels specify a 0 but others specifies a minimum value between you
off the panel and disable the PWM. The only reason I added the post
delay is because the different datasheets specifies it, I don't have a
use case that the post delay is used to fix something.
