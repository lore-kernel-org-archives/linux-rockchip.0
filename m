Doesn't creating a binding also have similar possibility? Maybe an
"attach host" or re-init hook would be more appropriate. I'm sure
there are other such cases where the host and phy need more tight
coupling. I recently had a similar case where there was an interleaved
sequence of phy and host register writes. I managed rework things and
avoid changing the phy interface, but there will certainly be cases
where we can't.

Changing function names in the kernel is easy. Changing the binding
later not so much. Also as we're looking toward dependency handling,
this creates a circular dependency. We'll probably have to deal with
those anyway, but here it seems a bit pointless. We already have a
connection between the host and phy defined. Let's use that and not
define another.

I think that should already be possible as you can have multiple
cells. Of course, you have to plan for that with your cell values.
