nope it doesn't :-) pclk_pd_pmu feeds pclk_gpio0.

Before the pinctrl patch, pclk_gpio0 was just statically on all the tim=
e, now=20
it gets turned off when bank0 is not in use (between reads/writes and i=
f no=20
interrupts are enabled). This in turn makes the clock framework turn of=
f=20
pclk_pd_pmu (and thus its other unhandled child-clocks).
