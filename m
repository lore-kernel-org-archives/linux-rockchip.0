Yes. Granted, the vast majority of users is not in this category, but
it's something that has been brought to my attention in the past and it
works fine with the current API.

Yes, the key here is glitch-free. There's no reason whatsoever that the
rugaltor-pwm driver should be limited to usage with a hardware readout-
capable PWM driver. If you don't care about glitches, likely because no
critical components depend on the regulator, you can simply force what
state you choose on boot.

As a matter of fact, I think that's how regulators work already. If the
current output voltage doesn't match the specified constraints, then a
valid value will be forced by the regulator core. If the voltage lies
within the constraints the core won't touch the regulator. Is this not
going to "just work" with the PWM regulator?

The problem is somewhat simplified if that's the case. An implementation
could then fail the regulator_get_voltage() if hardware readout is not
supported and return the current voltage when readout is possible.

How so? Drivers should behave consistently, irrespective of the API. Of
course if you need to change behaviour of the user driver depending on
the availability of a certain feature, that's perfectly fine.

Furthermore it's out of the question that changes to the API will be
required. That's precisely the reason why the atomic PWM proposal came
about. It's an attempt to solve the shortcomings of the current API for
cases such as Rockchip.

The device tree specifies the period because there is no way for the
driver (such as pwm-backlight) to "guess" the right one. Furthermore
there is a certain degree of board-specificity to that parameter and
therefore any heuristic trying to come up with a sensible value will
inevitably fail eventually.

Yes, exactly.

That's correct. The value retrieved by pwm_get_period() is the one
specified in DT (or a PWM lookup table). It should match the hardware
value after the first call to pwm_config(), though.

Yes.

Yes. I'm thinking that we should have a pwm_get_state() which retrieves
the current state of the PWM. For drivers that support hardware readout
this state should match the hardware state. For other drivers it should
reflect whatever was specified in DT; essentially what pwm_get_period()
and friends return today.

That way if you want to get the current voltage in the regulator-pwm
driver you'd simply do a pwm_get_state() and compute the voltage from
the period and duty cycle. If the PWM driver that you happen to use
doesn't support hardware readout, you'll get an initial output voltage
of 0, which is as good as any, really.

The atomic PWM API is this new API. I'm not arguing that we don't need
new API. What's being discussed is what the API needs to look like to
support this new use-case and at the same time be maximally compatible
with existing users.

I think perhaps one question that needs answering to do that is whether
or not the regulator-pwm driver can guess the correct period. The issue
that was initially being discussed is what to do with hardware state vs
initial state (i.e. what's defined in DT). Mark commented in another
subthread that DT should simply leave out data that doesn't make sense
to be specified.

However I don't think there's any particularly reasonable period for the
regulator-pwm use-case, so specifying the period within DT would still
be necessary. What works for one board may not be the correct (or
optimal) value for another. Similarly one board may need to invert the
PWM signal to generate the proper voltage, or require other parameters
that we haven't even defined yet.

There's also the issue of a voltage table that you need to define in the
DT for the regulator-pwm device. Does that consist of only duty-cycle
values, or does it have corresponding period values as well. I'd guess
that it really only needs the duty cycle given any period. So something
like this is what I'd expect:

	regulator {
		compatible = "regulator-pwm";

		pwms = <&pwm0 5000>;

		voltages = <0 0>, <1000000 1000>, ..., <5000000 5000>;
	};

I think the pwm-regulator binding defines the duty cycle in percent. I
guess that would work equally well.

And now we've come full circle because, again, we need to differentiate
between the current hardware state and the initial state. Or, as was
also discussed previously, alternatively, ignore the period specified in
DT and just go with what hardware readout defined. In case hardware
readout isn't supported, the "hardware state" will simply be the
"initial state".

The objection to the latter alternative was that we shouldn't trust the
firmware to have set up the regulator correctly. But if it didn't, how
can we trust that the duty cycle to period ratio is correct? Or the
other way around: if we trust the duty cycle to period ratio to have
been setup correctly, why don't we trust the period?
