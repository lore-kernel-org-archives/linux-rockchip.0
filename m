Ah, OK.  My main point was that this function needed to make sense on
its own.  ...and the function in your patch writes to [0] through [4]
without actually confirming that there are at least 5 elements.  I'd
be OK with:

  if ((size < frame->length || size < HDMI_AUDIO_INFOFRAME_SIZE)

OK, memset() here makes sense with what you say about the frame
needing to be 10 bytes big.
