Hello, Daniel.

Due to recent comments from Mark[1], may be is better to apply v6[2] =
series instead of v7[3]?
Because my main goal was to fix wall time on rk3188. And I did it the =
same way how that was
already done for other timer drivers (one of possible solution).

You can rename CLOCKSOURCE_OF to TIMER_OF later. I can help with that, =
but I don=E2=80=99t
think it is good idea to combine my changes and timer framework =
cleanups/improvements
into single series.

And I thinks, that probably is is better to drop [3] and [4] and revert =
0c8893c9095d ("clockevents: Add a
clkevt-of mechanism like clksrc-of=C2=BB).

What do you think?
