I think you've added a zero in your mind and not realized that I'm
calling regulator_set_voltage_tol() here and in other calls.  Please
read the above as:

* Try to set the voltage to exactly 1,200,000 uV (1.2V).
* If you can't get 1.2V exactly, a tolerance ("tol") of 100,000 uV
(.1V) is OK.
* In other words, 1.1V - 1.3V are OK, but aim for 1.2V

Again, check my zeros.  This should be 1.7 - 1.9V, aiming for 1.8V.

This will get us within .3V of whatever vmmc is.  If vmmc is 3.3V, it
will allow vqmmc of 3.0V - 3.6V.

This _seems_ sane to me and given any sane system design we should be
fine here, I think.  I can't see someone designing a system where
vqmmc was not within .3V of vmmc, can you?  If we think someone will
actually build a system where vmmc is 3.3V and vqmmc can't go higher
than 2.7V then we'll either need to increase the tolerance here or add
a new asymmetric system call like my original patches did.

Yeah, that does sound nice.  Are you suggesting that I modify this
patch or submit a new one.  Let me know.
