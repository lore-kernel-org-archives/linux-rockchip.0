hmm, but i saw the gpio-dwapb.c actually toggle trigger after handle 
irq, which might avoid the race Brian mentioned:
+               generic_handle_irq(gpio_irq);
+               irq_status &= ~BIT(hwirq);
+
+               if ((irq_get_trigger_type(gpio_irq) & IRQ_TYPE_SENSE_MASK)
+                       == IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH)
+                       dwapb_toggle_trigger(gpio, hwirq);


and i also saw ./qcom/pinctrl-msm.c do the 
toggle(msm_gpio_update_dual_edge_pos) at the end of 
msm_gpio_irq_set_type and msm_gpio_irq_ack, that seems can avoid the 
polarity races too.

right, so we now have 2 cases: rockchip_irq_demux/ rockchip_irq_set_type

if i'm right about the spurious irq(only happen when set rising for a 
high gpio, or set falling for a low gpio), then:

1/ rockchip_irq_demux
it's important to not losing irqs in this case, maybe we can

a) ack irq
b) update polarity for edge both irq

we don't need to disable irq in b), since we would not hit the spurious 
irq cases here(always check gpio level to toggle it)


2/ rockchip_irq_set_type
it's important to not having spurious irqs

so we can disable irq during changing polarity only in these case:
((rising && gpio is heigh) || (falling && gpio is low))

i'm still confirming the spurious irq with IC guys.
