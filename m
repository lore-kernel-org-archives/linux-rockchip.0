I had some problem with gmail and sending mail too much users. I put Rob

protection"

I think the main issue here is how to handle bot and how problematic is
to merge this. As written in the cover letter the final version of this
should be a big series of 50+ patch with every commit specific to each
oem. In theory we should be able to merge the different oem separately
and try to at least start the categorization. 
Another idea I got to at least have a "migration path" is to convert
every dts in the dts/ directory to a symbolic link that target the dts
in the correct oem. But I assume that would fix only part of the problem
and git am will still be problematic.

I know but we should really consider this kind of change. The current
state of the dts/ directory is embarassing and keeping it that way cause
only more problems and makes this even more difficult.
Hope we find a solution and fix this for good!
