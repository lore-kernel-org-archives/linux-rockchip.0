I'm unsure why, but I think there might be small variations in the 
different boards (Firefly, Libre).
On my board (Libre) with just 0x4 txpbl and thresh dma removed I get a 
whopping 30mbps.

Adding aal brought it up to 900 mbps.

I also had stability issues on rx, where it would bounce between 200 and 
400 mbps, which adding 0x4 rxpbl helped.
I still haven't been able to get rx above 400mpbs though.

It's definitely the MTU issue, since setting the max mtu to 1496 fixes 
most problems.

I have to wonder if the pl330 in the rk3328 is bugged, since all of the 
hardware that misbehaves (usb3, mmc, rgmii) require the dma engine.

If this works as a valid replacement for thresh dma mode, then I can 
submit it for merging.
I would like a few more people to test it first.

Anyone else with a rk3328-roc-cc board that can test this patch?
