Very good question, and it makes sense to dig into this...

OK, I think I've got it.  Dang printk bites me again.  I have serial
console enabled and my printouts were actually causing these delays.
With serial console turned off I reliably get ~280us for the interrupt
to fire (tested across SD and WiFi across 137 + 128 + 111 + 127 = 503
reboots)

I think it makes sense to land this patch anyway, but with an updated
description.  I'm happy to repost this or happy if you just want to
update the description when applying.

Although the cmd11 interrupt should come within 2ms, that's a very
short time.  Let's increase the timeout to be really sure that we
don't get an accidnetal timeout.  One case in particular this is
useful is if you've got a serial console and printk in just the right
places.  Under that scenario I've seen delays of up to 130ms before
the interrupt fired.

CMD11 is only sent during card insertion, so this extra timeout
shouldn't be terrible.
