This patchset is trying to reconstruct PCIe and PCIe-PHY driver
for rockchip platform in order to support per-lane PHY mode. And
we could idle the inactive lane(s) finally.

We deprecate the legacy PHY mode but the code could still support
it in order not to break backware compatibility of DTB. And I organize
the patches carefully so that we don't introduce git-bisect issue.

Hi Brian & Jeffy,

I tested it by backporting all things into my kernel 4.4 tree, and it
works fine for both legacy PHY mode and per-lane PHY model. However I
couldn't run 4.12 for my rk3399-evb now, so it would be nice if you
can test it with your chrome devices running v4.12.

Hi Rob,

Does the changes for rockchip-pcie.txt in patch 6 & 7 look good to you
from the perspective of DT?


Changes in v2:
- deprecate legacy PHY model
- improve rockchip_pcie_phy_of_xlate
- fix wrong calculation of pwr_cnt and add new init_cnt
- add internal locking
- introduce per-lane data to simply the code
- convert that for all rk3399 platforms
- make listing all 4 lanes as mandatory
