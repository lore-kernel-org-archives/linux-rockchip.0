oops, i see the problem.

so what if we do these:
1/ edge irq triggered
2/ read gpio level
3/ handle irq(ack irq)
4/ toggle edge mode(with a while gpio level check)

if the gpio changed in 2/ -> 3/, the 4/ will trigger an irq when writing 
GPIO_INT_POLARITY(which is what we are trying to avoid in the set_type case)

but this would not work if i'm wrong about how the HW fake an irq when 
changing POLARITY...


or maybe we could just check the gpio status again after 
handle_edge_irq, and correct the polarity in this case
