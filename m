You don't set pd->num_clks = 0 here, which means other places that
iterate over the clocks might race with this and try to use clocks that
have been unprepared/put.

This might be over-paranoid, but in particular, this could race with
rockchip_pd_power().

Also not setting the pd->num_clks to zero would be a problem for a
power-controller that is configured as a module which could be unloaded
and reloaded (I know that doesn't really work now, but it will
eventually, I hope.)

Maybe use the mutex here?  It should at least protect the zeroing of
pm->num_clks.
