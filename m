Hi Alexander,

I have been through the patchset and it is ok except for the patch 3/5.
I wanted to investigate a bit on this one because of the patch [2] you
are mentioning.

I think there is small missing piece of devicetree binding to specify
'clocksource' or 'clockevent'. Rob Herring is ok with an attribute of
this kind.

That would help to clearly separate these drivers without ambiguity.

However, it results on some duplicated code I'm not very happy with, so
that is my major issue with this approach I would like to solve. That is
the status today.

I wanted to take the opportunity of your changes to investigate this area.
