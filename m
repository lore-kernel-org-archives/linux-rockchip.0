Nitpick: Please drop braces

This looks inefficient. Hopefully we're not calling this all the time?
Except we call it from clk_get().

Maybe it would make sense to mark the clock as orphaned or not. When we
regsiter the clock we can see if the parent is there and if so, check
the parent's flag to see if it's orphaned or not. If it isn't orphaned
everything is good, cheap lookup to figure it out and we don't set the
flag. If it is orphaned, again cheap lookup and we set the flag. When we
adopt the clock (deorphan?) we would have to go through the clock and
all it's children to clear the flag. The cost is paid once. Then this
function becomes a cheap flag check that we can do whenever we want.

Unfortunately we still have to take some sort of lock here. If we had a
new lock, orphan_lock or something, then we could lock the adoption
phase and the flag setting of all clocks under that lock. When we go to
per-clock locks we could change that to use the lock for a particular clock.
