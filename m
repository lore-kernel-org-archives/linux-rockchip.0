The change looks obviously right, it's a noop.

I share your doubts however. The construct was introduced in commit 
831b2790507b ("pwm: rockchip: Use same PWM ops for each IP") by David
Wu.

Before there were rockchip_pwm_get_state_v1 for the supports_polarity =
false case and rockchip_pwm_get_state_v2 for supports_polarity = true.

In both state->enabled was assigned true if ((val & enable_conf) ==
enable_conf). So I assume everything is fine.

A confirmation by David would be great though.

As a side note: Is there publicly available documentation for this IP?
If a link were added to the driver's header we could check easily
ourselves.

Best regards
Uwe
