I applied this to pci/host-rockchip for v4.11.  I added Brian's Reviewed-by
and Rob's Acked-by, since you didn't change anything substantive.

I assume there's no way to automatically discover whether the system is
using the 24MHz oscillator?  If there is a way, we should use that instead
of requiring a DT property.

I reworded the changelog; I hope it still make sense:

    PCI: rockchip: Disable RC's ASPM L0s based on DT "aspm-no-l0s"
    
    Rockchip's RC produces a 100MHz reference clock but there are two methods
    for the PHY to generate it:
    
      (1) Use the system PLL to generate a 100MHz clock.  The PHY will relock
          it, filter signal noise, and output the reference clock.  ASPM L0s
          works correctly, but circuit noise issues make it difficult to pass
	  the TX compatibility test.
    
      (2) Share the SoC's 24MHZ crystal oscillator with the PHY and force the
          PHY's PLL to generate 100MHz internally.  In this case, exit from
          ASPM L0s sometimes fails due to a design error in the RC receiver
          circuit.  Even if we use extended-synch, the PHY sometimes fails to
          relock the bits from FTS, which will hang the system.
    
    We want the flexibility to use both clocking methods, so add a DT property,
    "aspm-no-l0s".  If that's present, disable L0s to avoid the issues with
    case (2).
