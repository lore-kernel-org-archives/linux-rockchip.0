yep this is some sort of policy-decision ... I'm perfectly fine with changing 
the default behaviour from my Rockchip-pov but was reluctant to do this for 
everybody.

For example in the cited example in patch1, the clock from an i2c-device 
supplies a soc-clock and the soc-clock only gets enabled/disabled at this 
point. The i2c-device is default on, so everything works till it falls over 
when going to suspend. So I guess similar corner cases might exist on other 
platforms.

It might very well be better to change the behaviour and hope for little 
fallout to fix.

So, it looks like your on favour of preventing the usage of orphans 
altogether, so I'll try to come up with a better implementation taking into 
account your comments to patch2.


Thanks
Heiko
