     Based your reply to John, I rebuild the code like bellow, I hope t=
his
     is what you mean.

     DTS file:
     reboot-mode {
                         compatible =3D "syscon-reboot-mode";
                         offset =3D <0x94>;
                         mode-normal =3D <BOOT_NORMAL>;
                         mode-recovery =3D <BOOT_RECOVERY>;
                         mode-fastboot =3D <BOOT_FASTBOOT>;
                         mode-loader =3D <BOOT_LOADER>;
                         mode-maskrom =3D <BOOT_MASKROM>;
                 };


    driver:

     #define PREFIX "mode-"

     struct property *prop;
     size_t len =3D strlen(PREFIX);
     for_each_property_of_node(dev->of_node, prop) {
                 if (len > strlen(prop->name) || strncmp(prop->name,=20
PREFIX, len))
                         continue;
                 info =3D devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*info), GFP_KERNEL);
                 if (!info)
                         return -ENOMEM;
                 strcpy(info->mode, prop->name + len);
                 if (of_property_read_u32(dev->of_node, prop->name,=20
&info->magic)) {
                         dev_err(dev, "reboot mode %s without magic=20
number\n",
                                 info->mode);
                         devm_kfree(dev, info);
                         continue;
                 }
                 list_add_tail(&info->list, &reboot->head);
         }
