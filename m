I'm in the middle of the Netherlands right now on vacation, so I'm
probably not doing any display hacking till the middle of next week.

So depending on your spare time, I'd guess it might be interesting to
also activate the debug output in the hdmiphy driver itself to see
requested and actually set rates for the pll inside the hdmiphy.

Because that is my current theory of where the issue might sit.
