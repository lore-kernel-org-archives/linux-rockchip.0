Good question, it's derived from Doug's patch for CrOS 3.14 and
https://crrev.com/c/1575556 also from Doug. Let's say I did the
porting to upstream, but I'm pretty sure Doug spent more time on it.

Maybe I should resend it with Doug as author and include the original
commit message, which has more information.
