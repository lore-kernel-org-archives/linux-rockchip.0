Re: the trial and error: it might be the case that the panels actually
work at 1506 vtotal if you also adjust the sync length and/or back
porch "accordingly", whatever that accordingly would be for this panel
since the datasheet doesnt tell. I missed this point when i was doing
my testing and just adjusted the variables with the most
"adjustability" (bigger starting value) to them.

Honestly I was just doing this because i really liked the idea of
actually making it 60Hz and my eyes arent that good at noticing
high-fps things - i think the one case where it might be visible to a
keen eye is 720p60 playback where you'd need to skip "about 2" (1.7..)
frames a second if running at 58.3 Hz. But currently the C201 isnt
doing a lot of that given i dont think i/we have a good software setup
for it. That could be changing in the future with panfrost and the VPU
hardware decoder support, etc.

Anyways I'm thinking it would be prudent to first get this framework
of device-tree modes in and then maybe adjust the mode later.

Testing the 60Hz mode is simple enough:
xrandr --newmode 1366x768p60 74.25 1366 1453 1483 1543 768 776 790 802
-HSync -VSync
xrandr --addmode eDP-1 1366x768p60
xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 1366x768p60

(The mode name can be anything...)
So meanwhile I would appreciate it if we could get some test reports
of the mode with other veyron chromebooks that have this panel :)
