While it is currently implemented for sateless m2m codec drivers as example
(because we can't implement this everywhere at once really, its not practic=
al),
there is no reason why we cannot track to a process fdinfo memory usage
associated with other video devices. In fact, I would pretty much want to s=
ee
capture devices showing up in v4l2top, as these are using a lot of memory t=
oo,
specially the new camera pipelines. And this is also perfectly suitable for
stateful codec, converters, everything.

So please, let's agree this is not "stateless V4L2 codec drivers" specific.

About VIDIOC_LOG_STATUS, this is effectively broken for m2m, only the ownin=
g
session process could call that. Its also pretty bad for tools to have to
monitor the dmesg and filter it up. fdinfo on the other end, does not requi=
re
opening the device and permissions are very clear, and bound to user proces=
s.

With that said, we can refine, but not in that direction.

We should work further on the type system, then we'd simply have to extend =
it.
Different type of driver will provide different key/value pair. We should w=
ell
document which key are mandatory for the type (or for all type, like giving=
 a
name for general identification purpose).

Of course, the current proposal is very torward processing cores, hence the=
 one
to one match with what GPUs present in fdinfo today in mainline, such are
frequency, core utilization time, etc.

Though, DMA devices such as capture may expose more of a bandwidth kind of
information. I really don't want to make up too may cases, so owners of the=
se
don't feel like this is mandated though. As we develop software using our
drivers, we should be able to figure-out what kind of things are important =
to
monitor. For CODECs, we have two majors things. a) core utilization (which =
can
be with a timer like this one, but ideally using cycle counters, or firmwar=
e
provided data). b) memory usage.

I would guess this is bound to usage of cycle counter, which we definitely =
have
in some codec HW exposing. As the frequency fluctuate, I suppose there is w=
ays
you can get your calculation a bit off, as this is being sampled. Basically=
, the
frequence change is not strictly tracked by our drivers, which is ok. But I=
 also
don't seen why we wouldn't keep the counters monotonic, its really easy to =
do.

The word "engine" seems indeed alien in this subsystem. It is referring to =
a
system where you open one devices, so you have one fdinfo, but multiple cor=
es.
Each cores may be running at it owns frequency. But I think this is a littl=
e too
vague to my taste.

Hope this feedback does not cross to many wires, but tagging this as specif=
ic to
stateless codec drivers did spark a little in my head. And we are really in=
 need
for a way to monitor our drivers.
