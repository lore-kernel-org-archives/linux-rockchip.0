Then either the regulator is optional or you don't say it is a w9013
for that board. But if you do need to initialize the device and
therefore know what type of device it is, then you need a compatible
for the device. It's when things really vary by board that we add DT
properties.

No, the soldered down devices require all sorts of extra non-SDIO
connections and we do specify the device in those cases.

It's both. The device defines what is needed and the specs to control
them (active states of GPIOs, de/assertion times of resets, supply
voltages, etc.). The board only determines what the connections are
and if you can control them.
