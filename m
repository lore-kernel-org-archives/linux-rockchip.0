I'm not sure I understand correctly. Are these PHYs exchangeable? Does
the DesignWare IP provide them or could they be provided separately? I
see register definitions for a "source" PHY and a "master" PHY, where
the latter seems to be an I2C controller rather than a PHY. Perhaps it
is used to communicate with an external PHY?

Can somebody give me a quick summary (or point me to documentation) on
how this works?

Perhaps VP_FILT* are sourced from the same supply as VP, so maybe we
don't have to care at the DT level?

A rather common nuisance with these licensed IP blocks is that some of
the details may be hidden in SoC glue, resulting in the interface being
different on each SoC. Given all of the above it sounds like i.MX could
have some internal glue to supply VP and VPH and there'd be no sensible
way to represent them in DT.

Does DesignWare by any chance offer documentation about the IP? If not I
agree that the safest thing to do for now would be to make this Rockchip
specific. If it should prove to be generic after all (in which case i.MX
would seem to provide SoC glue to supply them) we can still promote the
supplies to be generic. They'd need to be optional to handle the i.MX,
though. Or perhaps a dummy regulator could be referenced, representing
the SoC-internal supply to the block. Maybe there even is a (SoC-
specific) way to control this internal regulator?
