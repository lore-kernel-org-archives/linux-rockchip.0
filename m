Re-NAK.  I don't think your point #1 is valid.  See my other reply.

You are over-estimating what grub does.  Grub doesn't resolve UUIDs at
all.  Grub just passes the kernel arguments in its configuration file
for the entry it is booting to the kernel.  It's a static configuration
found in /boot/grub/grub.conf.

It doesn't probe devices for UUIDs.

In _my_ world with the "embedded" devices I have, I mount by UUID on
platforms which have multiple MMC devices to avoid exactly the problem
you're having.  This works fine.

If I were to switch the SD card, and I wanted to avoid changing the
boot loader configuration, I'd use label instead, and I'd label all
the SD card rootfs using the same label so I could just swap the cards.

You've got a funny view again.  N2100 has two hard disks.  The clearfog
board from SolidRun has two mini-PCIe slots, each of which can have two
SATA interfaces... If you want to use it as a server-type platform with
lots of disks...

One of my Versatile Express platforms boots from USB, and has a MMC
slot...  So this argument does not stack up.

Sorry.
