Hmm, possibly fell through some cracks.

They way I read that thread is that you are trying to disable the Globa=
l Timer
for the wrong reasons, not that having status =3D "disabled" is not a g=
ood choice.
DT *does* describe the HW, but there is nothing from stopping someone t=
o say in the DT
that a specific HW is OFF. Removing the node description from DT would =
be wrong, because
the HW is there, we just want it disabled. Having status =3D "disabled"=
 is similar to having
a software OFF button.

Now, the only issue one might have is when the HW is enabled at power o=
n and active. In
that case, marking it with status =3D "disabled" is indeed wrong, becau=
se there's going
to be a disconnect between the state of the HW and what the DT says is =
being active. But
the timers are not really active until setup, so you should be able to =
play with the
status property.

=46irst of all you probably need to separate the issues you have with T=
WD versus
the GT timer, they are two different pieces of IP and have individual d=
rivers.

When it comes to CPUidle, the TWD timer does the right thing: if there =
is no
"always-on" property in the DT then it will set the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3ST=
OP bit in
the features and so the clk framework will know that the clock will be =
disabled
when the core goes idle and will look for another clock source for wake=
ups. What
it does seem to be missing is the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PERCPU flag though, bu=
t that seems
to be a very underused flag in kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c.

As for the GT timer and CPUidle, something similar to the TWD timer nee=
ds done (i.e
set C3STOP feature if the clock is not marked as always on).

=46or the issues that you are seeing with CPUfreq, I'm afraid I need mo=
re info on that.

I'm not NAK-ing the patch for the moment until we understand if there a=
re better
options (and patches) for your problem, but I still fail to see how you=
 are going
to use this patch in the scenario that your commit message describes. I=
f you compile
a kernel to work on both SoC-A and SoC-B you still end up having GT tim=
er enabled for
SoC-B.

Maybe commit message needs changed to say something like "Make ARM_GLOB=
AL_TIMER a
selectable feature for builds that want to disable the functionality".
