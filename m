yes, if we want to support burst mode, both of the master(pl330) and
client(several peripherals) should implement it, otherwise it will
be broken when enabling.

So I mentioned it on my cover letter as the reason to introduce this
optional property. If people add this property and find it's ok for
their platform, they could land new dt-patch to add it. But we could
*not* presume that we could get all users involved in testing this
patchet. I don't wanna to break any other platforms, so it's needed.


Thanks.
