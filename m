you should in general not touch the DPLL. This is the dedicated DDR
pll and changing the DDR frequency involves a lot more than just
changing the pll. So if for some reason the dpll is not at 300MHz coming
from the bootloader, this will hang the system.

Same for the APLL - we have cpufreq for that and changing the cpu
frequency also involves adapting the voltage in most cases.

where do these completely unround number come from? They don't correspond
to any of your pll settings and look way out of place.

You might want to target similar values as on rk3066 and rk3288 for core
clocks [aclk 300MHz, hclk 150MHz, pclk 75MHz]?

This puts them nicely into the recommended operating conditions from
the rk3188 datasheet. Similarly you might want cpll, gpll at 400MHz / 594 MHz
to provide a base to derive needed rates from.
[Again see rk3066a.dtsi please]
