Yes, I could not get the description of fast-mode plus data_hold_ns, bu=
t=20
I saw that the maximum tHD;DAT must be less than the maximum of=20
tVD;DATor tVD;ACKby for Standard-mode and Fast-mode.

So I think the maximum tHD;DAT for Fast-mode Plus should be less than=20
the maximum of tVD;DATor tVD;ACKby too, the maximum of tVD;DATor=20
tVD;ACKby is 450ns, and 400ns is my taking a conservative value.

Description form UM10204
[4] The maximum tHD;DATcould be 3.45=CE=BCs and 0.9=CE=BCs for Standard=
-mode and=20
=46ast-mode, but must be less than the maximum of tVD;DATor tVD;ACKby a=
=20
transition time. This maximum must only be met if the device does not=20
stretch the LOW period (tLOW) of the SCL signal. If the clock stretches=
=20
the SCL, the data must be valid by the set-up time before it releases
the clock.
