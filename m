Right.

Yes, I would appreciate it if we have devm wrapper for
clk_prepare_enable so that we don't resort to devm_add_action_or_reset.

IIRC, some of the other ARM SoCs have the same problem.

So that is my concern as well. But I have to say we may face a worse
situation as I see it by randomly search the DT,

arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7795.dtsi  includes a power-domains
for pcie-rcar and pcie-rcar registers shared irq either. So the power-
domain would be powered off once failing to probe or calling ->remove()
immediately even *before* doing devm cleanup. In another word, I don't
have too much confident that renesas's CPU could visit PCIe IP w/o power
domain in 'on' state?

I posted a relevant patch for fixing this for driver core but havn't got
any input from there (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/15/146). That don't
affect pcie-rockchip *now* as we don't have power-domain for that but
it's highly relevant to the problem we are disscussing.

Finally, as a life-saving straw if we don't reach an agreement for
anyone of adding devm clk_prepare_enable wrraper and adjusting the
sequence of powering off power-domain, we have to get rid of using
devm_request_irq and use request_irq/free_irq instead for all
the potential problematic drivers...
