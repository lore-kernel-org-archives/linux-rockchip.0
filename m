Well, I got what you mean. I saw phy_power_on() gets called  twice at=20
ehci/ohci driver probe time, one is at pdata->power_on(); another is at=
=20
usb_add_hcd(), so after that, the power_count of phy increases to two.=20
however, when ehci/ohci driver goes to suspend, there is only once to=20
call phy_power_off(), and the power_count of phy decreases to 1, so our=
=20
usb2phy_resume() could not be invoked :-) .

If so, is it still need to care it? How about use suspended member of=20
rockchip_usb2phy_port as a conditional to check in *_usb2phy_suspend(),=
=20
if necessary.
