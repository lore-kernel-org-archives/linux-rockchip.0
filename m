While vin-supply is optional, I think that is meant for real top-level 
regulators (our vcc_sys or whatever) that really don't have a parent 
regulator.

It is always nicer to model the whole power-tree [in a sane way], as it makes 
following the schematics a lot easier. If you mount a debugfs these days you 
can even get a nice tree graph of the regulator infrastructure ... where the 
parent-relationship is also needed to create something meaningful.
