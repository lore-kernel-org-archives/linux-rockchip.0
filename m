We'll just give Jonas a bit more time to reply then :-) .

No, that is not necessary. I'll just drop the line when applying.
In general for a tag to mean something we need the Name, but any
tags other than Signed-off-by are optional anyway.

No, re-sending just to correct tags is not necessary in _my_ case
as I generally just fix up the relevant lines myself when applying.
Just keep in mind, other maintainers may handle this differently :-) .

Really no problem, it's always a learning experience.
So don't worry too much :-) .
