The patch

   ASoC: rt5514-spi: only enable wakeup when fully initialized

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt5514-spi: only enable wakeup when fully initialized

If an rt5514-spi device is probed but the platform hasn't linked it in,
we might never fully request the SPI IRQ, nor configure the rt5514 DSP,
but we still might try to enable the SPI IRQ (enable_irq_wake()). This
is bad, and among other things, can cause the interrupt to trigger every
time we try to suspend the system (e.g., because the interrupt trigger
setting was never set properly).

Instead of setting our wakeup capabilities in the SPI driver probe
routine, let's wait until we've actually requested the IRQ.

Fixes issues seen on the "kevin" Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook Plus).
