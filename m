so I've looked in mainline, chromeos-4.4 and the Rockchip vendor-kernel
and the only board using that property at all is the rk3399-evb-rev1
and -rev2 in the vendor kernel.

The existence of a further -rev3 (which also looks way better cared for
compared rev1+2) indicates that the older ones are probably some sort
of preproduction models, where some wiring (on the soc or board) may
have gone wrong.

So while I would keep all the avalid settings in the driver, we could just
drop reading that property quietly - as Rob wrote some days ago
"it's only an incompatible change if someone notices" [0] and from the
above it doesn't look like it ;-) .
