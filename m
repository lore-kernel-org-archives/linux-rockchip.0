Hi Romain,

I've applied the patch to my dts branch for 4.3 after fixing some smallish 
issues:

both the board description as well as the Makefile did not apply cleanly, as

Please try to base patches on either linux-next or my version specific topic

removed the dvs_1 and dvs_2 pinctrl accesses here.

too.
