Sure, I can do that.

Huh? Why? So I can revert that in the next patch?

I do see value in it. That's the whole reason I wrote this patchset.
It's useful for stressing out certain behaviors that will happen all the
time (i.e., boot-time initialization, from platform probe, to bus init,
to client/EP init), via repeated bind/unbind (or modprobe/rmmod). It's
much faster than reboot testing.

Personally, I'd rather just patch the other drivers, and you can wait
until I follow through on that promise before applying my existing work
for the Rockchip driver, if that's what you'd prefer.

Sure. But you only just pointed out how broken several drivers were; I
didn't really notice :)
