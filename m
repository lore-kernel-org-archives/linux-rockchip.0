Thanks for giving it a try!

Did your code ensure to perform the SMC call for the first frequency
change? If not the problem could be that the DDR PD timings and ODT
resistors are not properly configured for the new frequency.

In case you already did this or it doesn't help I think it's fine to
just do the call always, we can always revisit this later.

Great!
