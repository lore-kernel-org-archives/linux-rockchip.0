Thanks Heiko,

Yes I like the refactoring. Patch 1 effectively making no changes, but 
rearranging files so the tinker board device tree can be used as a 
template for others. Patch 2 then adding the Tinker Board S, with the 
only major change being adding the eMMC - and that change is relatively 
simple.

These two patches by themselves are enough to get the Tinker Board S 
functional, and that they should be uncontroversial hopefully means they 
will go through.

The WiFi change, I also had my doubts over - hence why it was a separate 
patch. For what it is worth, it was what was needed to get the WiFi up 
on: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/SFdoQHC3z2hvoufdAmxs/ - hence 
why submitted.

My own problems with it:
1) I believe that the tinker board has wi-fi in which case it should be 
common - but know of no one with a plain tinker board - hence why to 
post, so if someone can test. Then if so apply to the tinker-board.dtsi
2) Parts of the patch are clear (e.g. enabling sdio0 - as that is how 
the wifi data is wired up); but other parts (e.g. uart0 pinctrl, and the 
sdio_pwrseq) and although these seem needed - the connection is vague to 
the WiFi. What can I say, but these were in the original ASUS patch.

So on WiFi I can understand if discussion is needed.

Regards,

David.

P.S. and thanks for the git commands - first time I've used git in 
anger, e.g. hadn't realised the importance of the "git commit" message 
for how it is used in "git format-patch". I'll get better at this with 
time ....
