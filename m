clock names are always in the scope of the node/driver, so the names could 
easily be "aclk", "aclk-perf", "hclk", "phy".

Although from my cursory-glance at the phy-related code, it looks more like 
it shouldn't be in the pcie-driver itself, but in a an actual phy-driver 
(together with the phy reset and clock)?

Same as above, names could simply be "sys", "legacy", "client"

and again (= without the "-rst")

These are GRF offsets (GRF_SOC_CON8, GRF_SOC_CON5_PCIE, GRF_SOC_STATUS1)
Those registers are generally prone to change (even their layout) for future 
socs and I'd suggest instead of declaring them in the devicetree, move them 
to the per-soc data in the rockchip_pcie_of_match struct.

But it looks as if they're pretty phy-specific, so see comment about possible 
separate phy driver above.

I'm not sure if pinctrl-properties need to be described when you don't need 
special handling in the form of additional pin states. The pcie part does 
not do any pin-handling of its own.

Again that (assigned-clocks handling) is not actual part of the pci-
controllers actions, but other parts and also described already elsewhere.
