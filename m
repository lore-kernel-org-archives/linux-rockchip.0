I wouldn't necessarily think so ... what is called critical only means =
"don't=20
turn off when walking the clock-tree upwards".

The pclk_pd_pmu for example simply supplies some more clocks we don't h=
andle=20
at all currently (pclk_pmu_noc, ...). That we currently choose to ignor=
e those=20
[because we don't have any code nor dt-bindings to handle the component=
s=20
supplied] sounds very much like an implementation-specific detail, not=20
something about the hardware.

I really like the concept of critical clock handling Mike is working on=
, which=20
implements some sort of hand-off and keeps so marked clocks on until a =
real=20
components picks them up.
