Two problems:
- "disallowing future muxing to the pll" feels a bit far on the "policy"-
side on the policy<->hw-description scale, I still guess the kernel should 
be allowed to shoot itself in the foot :-)
- would probably include hacking up the clock parent-names, which won't work 
at runtime, as they are init params and get memcpy'd on clk creation.

But I guess this issue of depending clock maybe needing to adapt to a 
changed pll-rate here would be solvable with my rate-reassignment I still 
need to revisit.

Right now I see two issues:
- can the drm reassign vops at runtime [don't know enough about drm], but 
what would happen in such a case when hdmi jumps from one to the other vop.
- clock-flags [CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT and friends] are clk-init data, set when 
creating a clock, so there is no changing this at runtime - see above

I guess one option to handle this could be to not have anybody getting a 
real CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to the vpll, but instead having the vops handle 
this special pll if necessary. Aka check if the requested rate is possible 
using the current sources (clk_round_rate on the dclk_vopX) and if not adapt 
the special pll to a suitable source rate and re-check.

And if there is no dclk-vpll, then simply skip that step and try to get the 
best rate possible.

Having the "rockchip,dclk-pll = <&...>;" live in the display-subsystem node 
or so (=assigned to the global display-subsystem not one special vop) the 
available vops might even be able to work out between them who should get 
access to it depending on connected displays / modes?
