looks ok, especially as the TRM I have doesn't list neither irqs :-)
But please explain the second Signed-off by Fabio?

If Fabio is the original author, the patch From should reflect that
and the Signed-off-by lines should be swapped. As it is now
I would expect Fabio being the one sending the patches.
Or is it supposed to be a "Co-developed-by:"?
See Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst.


Thanks
