Bummer!

I wonder if a relatively inoffensive DT hack would be an appropriate
solution in this case, since the conflicting compatible string is a
somewhat special case and this change only affects the DT and the
driver/glue of a specific device (family).

The hack would consist in adding an additional 'compatible' entry to
the DT entry of the codec, which is ignored by the rt5514 driver, and
only used by the sound glue to identify it:

--- a/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru.dtsi
+++ b/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru.dtsi
@@ -671,7 +671,7 @@ ap_i2c_mic: &i2c1 {
        i2c-scl-rising-time-ns = <300>;
 
        headsetcodec: rt5514@57 {
-               compatible = "realtek,rt5514";
+               compatible = "realtek,rt5514", "realtek,rt5514-i2c";


And then use "realtek,rt5514-i2c" in dailink_compat.

Mark, would you prefer a hack like this over the list of codec names
or do you have any other suggestions?
