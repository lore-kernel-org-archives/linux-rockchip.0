We can add more domains node in the future.
This patch add the needed clocks into power-controller.
As the discuess about all the device clocks being listed in
the power-domains itself.

There are several reasons as follows:

Firstly, the clocks need be turned off to save power when
the system enter the suspend state. So we need to enumerate
the clocks in the dts. In order to power domain can turn on and off.

Secondly, the reset-circuit should reset be synchronous on RK3288,
then sync revoked. So we need to enable clocks of all devices.
In other words, we have to enable the clocks before you operate them
if all the device clocks are included in someone domians.

Thirdly, as the chip designs for PM hardhare. we need turn on the noc
clocks, if we are operating the "pd_vio" domain to enter the idle status.
The device's clock be included in domains that needed turn on if do that.

The clocks in the dts are needed to enable before you want to happy work.
At the moment, This patch is very good work for PM hardware.

Also, we can add it in the future if we have some hidden clocks.

Changes in v17:
- remove clocks of the HDMI ctrl.
- update the description.
- add Reviewed-by: Michale.

Changes in v16:
- Manually copy the problem in patch v15.
- rebase the description.

Changes in v15:
- As Tomasz remarked previously the dts should represent the hardware
  and the power-domains are part of the pmu.

Changes in v14:
- Remove essential clocks from rk3288 PD_VIO domain, Some clocks are
  essential for the system health and should not be turned down.
  However there is no owner for them so if they listed as belonging to power
  domain we'll try toggling them up and down during power domain transition.
  As a result we either fail to suspend or resume the system.

Changes in v13: None
Changes in v12: None
Changes in v11: None
Changes in v10:
- fix missing the #include <dt-bindings/power-domain/rk3288.h>.
- remove the notes.

Changes in v9:
- add decription for power-doamin node.

Changes in v8:
- DTS go back to v2.

Changes in v7: None
Changes in v6: None
Changes in v5: None
Changes in v4: None
Changes in v3:
- Decomposition power-controller, changed to multiple controller
  (gpu-power-controller, hevc-power-controller).

Changes in v2:
- make pd_vio clocks all one entry per line and alphabetize.
- power: power-controller move back to pinctrl: pinctrl.
