In general, the slowdown won't be _this_ much if touchscreen drivers ne=
ed=20
one deferral-round before i2c is available. I'm also only pointing out=20
things I remember from the last time this came up.=20

rk3x-i2c even was here already:

because it's the only safe way to do that. Because now you need i2c-ini=
t at=20
subsys-init time, some months later some other soc may need some other=20
ordering, especially needing i2c-init later/earlier.

Going through the deferral mechanism is the only way currently availabl=
e to=20
actually make this work on all socs.

Tomeu from Collabora is working on some better scheme to optimize devic=
e=20
probing order but it looks like this may be a bit off still.

Having touchscreen drivers support its proper supply-regulators is not=20
rocket science ;-) [0] , so I would consider this a bug in the touchscr=
een=20
driver itself.

Just look into the datasheet and add the appropriate supplies to the dr=
ivers=20
in question.
