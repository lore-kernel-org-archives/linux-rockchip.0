Good plan. As far as I can tell their kernel doesn't send anything but
BTN_LEFT either. It's just that the controller supports multiple
buttons, but not all are necessarily connected to any button.
Their version of the driver has logic to detect the proper keymap
whereas the mainline driver gets it from this devicetree entry.
