Hmm, I don't really understand this.
What method of core-bringup does the rk3228 use? In the current
rk322x.dtsi there is no enable-method at all defined.

So is the rk3228 firmware using a different method than the rk3229?

And out of curiosity as this is a arm32 without atf, is the psci
implementation (for uboot?) you're using available somewhere?


Thanks
Heiko
