Me too.

As I have stated several times, the PM code for SDIO is fragile/broken
for many scenarios. This is just one case.

We did a similar fix for sdhci recently. Simply, in cases when sdio
IRQ is turned on, we call pm_runtime_get_noresume() to prevent the
device from being runtime suspended.

Unless the SoC supports the SDIO irq to be re-routed to a wakeup IRQ
at runtime suspend, there is no other solution. However, re-routing to
a wakeup IRQ should be done, when switching to 1-bit mode is
completed. This is currently not supported by the mmc core.

I think that depends on the PM topology of the SoC. Perhaps the dw_mmc
devices are in PM domains sharing power rails etc, and preventing
runtime PM could be very costly as it then prevent those shared
resources to be put into low power state.

I think the best we can do at this point is something similar as we do
for sdhci.

As stated above, the system PM and runtime PM code for SDIO is fragile
and needs an update. I know how to do it, but it requires some work. I
have started to hack on it several times, maybe I just need to put
everything else aside and focus on this. :-)

Moreover, I would really like to invent the feature being able to
defer system PM resume of the SDIO card (in cases when it means a full
re-init of the SDIO card) to runtime PM resume instead. Why? It would
saves several hundreds of milliseconds in system PM resume time. The
very similar feature as we already have for SD/(e)MMC.

I think this should be managed in the dw_mmc driver instead, as it is
there the problem lies.

Again, dw_mmc is the correct place.

If the WIFI chip supports an external SDIO irq pin, that is very much
preferred. Both from PM point of view, but actually also from
performance point of view (mainly because it's faster to ack the IRQ).

That said, for these scenarios, I assume the switching to 1-bit mode
isn't necessary before gating the clock, as the IRQ is driven
completely separately from the SDIO bus. From my own experience, this
is how cw1200 WIFI chip behaves on ux500.

Right.

Perhaps the MMC core needs to play a role, not sure exactly how yet.

No. Then it's better to just prevent runtime suspend when SDIO irq
becomes enabled.

Dough, really appreciate you efforts in testing this and the detailed
way you describes the problem.

Kind regards
