Yup.  Hence the "normally signalled".  ;)

Yes, I believe this to be the case too.  It has always been on my TODO
list to see if I could figure out how to make this work, but it never
rose to the top.

One thing I wasn't sure about: is SDIO truly stateless enough that you
could fully power down the controller while you were waiting for an
interrupt?  I've never dug down that far into the protocol.

For certain, though, you wouldn't want to remove VMMC from an SDIO
card while waiting for an interrupt.  This contrasts to an SD or eMMC
memory card where you could plausibly do that if you're not actively
reading from or writing to the card (though I think some cards may do
background garbage collection, so maybe?? you could interfere with
that?)

Most certainly!  If you can come up with something better then I'd be happy!
