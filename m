Hello Chris,

for PHY reset there are properties 'reset-gpios' and 'reset-delay-us',
please reference to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/mdio.txt

Can you try to reuse them instead of adding new custom properties?

As a side question, which is mainly addressed to Sergei and Roger,
I don't quite understand why PHY properties were initially added to
MAC/MDIO bus device tree nodes, in my opinion they must be moved under
PHY device tree nodes.
