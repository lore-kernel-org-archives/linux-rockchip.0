There is serious disconnect as to what asynchronous and synchronous
probing means. You do not go "back" to synchronous probing.

	/*
	 * Indicates whether we are considering asynchronous probing or
	 * not. Only initial binding after device or driver registration
	 * (including deferral processing) may be done asynchronously, the
	 * rest is always synchronous, as we expect it is being done by
	 * request from userspace.
	 */
	bool check_async;

So synchronous means that when you register device or driver we dun
probe immediately on the same thread that registered said device or
driver, while with async we _may_ schedule on a workqueue (but if the
system has already scheduled too much async it will be probed
synchronously or immediately).

So in the case we are discussing the probing of phy device is indeed
synchronous/immediate relative to the thread where the phy device is
registered.

No. We have identified (at least IMO) that what phylib does is wrong. I
am not advocating forcing this PCI host to be marked for asycn probing
right now, before the phy issue is fixed, but I object to adding
workarounds to driver core which hurt other cases and may lead to phylib
never be fixed.

Again, your expectation of what sync probing means differs from what I
had in mind when implementing it. PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS is typically
for drivers/modules that register both a device (typically a singleton)
and a driver, and want to unregister both and free all resources when
initialization fails for some reason. Think cases like PC keyboard
controller.
