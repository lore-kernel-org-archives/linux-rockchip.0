Hi!

The RK3576 TRM isn't public, but the same hardware is used in the
RK3506, which does have its TRM online from Rockchip themselves:
https://opensource.rock-chips.com/images/3/36/Rockchip_RK3506_TRM_Part_1_V1.2-20250811.pdf

See chapter 31 of this. Right now, this counter driver implements
what's briefly described in Chapter 31.3.1 "Capture Mode".

Correct. In fact, your diagram is very close to what's in the
aforementioned chapter.

I checked the TRM and couldn't see any word on whether the count
is updated on the clock's rising edge only, but judging by Damon
Ding's review, I assume that is the case. I'll modify it to
reflect that.

Will do!

Yeah, that's a great point. I think we can say it "increases",
in that either HPC or LPC are increased by the pwm_clk signal
based on the value of the pwm_in signal by the hardware.

But of course, the two counts are limited by the full period
of the PWM waveform. So reading a counter will give the
reader a snapshot view of the high cycles vs. low cycles of
the last observed PWM waveform period, which is both a duty
cycle sample and a period length sample, as the counts are
in clock cycles, so if we add the counts together we get the
PWM signal period in clock cycles.

This is also why you saw me convert counts to nanoseconds in a
previous revision; it felt like I should decouple it from the clock,
but I think the can of worms that this opens isn't worth it.

Good call, will do.

It's actually intentional, and not redundant. The if (enable) branch
does an mfpwm_acquire() so that as long as the counter functionality
is enabled, the use count remains > 0. This way, the PWM output
driver can't tell the mfpwm driver that it'd like to have exclusive
use of the PWM device now, as the counter driver is claiming it.

To balance this, the else block here needs to release it.

The release outside the else block is to balance the acquire
earlier in the function, the pair of which is there to ensure
mfpwm has powered on the hardware and associated clocks for
the register reads and writes.

Admittedly, I could get rid of the additional mfpwm_acquire
in the if (enable) branch by letting the function entry acquire
"leak" on purpose, by getting rid of the function end mfpwm_release.
But this feels less obvious to me than the current way. I'll
definitely add comments though to indicate what's going on, and
maybe even define a cleanup.h guard() class for the function
level acquire-release.

Thanks for the review, and especially the explanations.

Kind regards,
Nicolas Frattaroli
