I'm unfortunately not a good evaluator of SDIO/MMC stuff, so I'll mostly
leave that to others and assume that the "replug" description is pretty
much all I need to know.

I'm very mildly unhappy to see this driver diverge from the PCIe one
again, but the only way it makes sense to do things the same is if there
is such thing as a "function level reset" for SDIO (i.e., doesn't also
kill the Bluetooth function). But it appears we don't really have such a
thing.

^^^ FTR, the "save_adapter" note was already obsolete as of

  cc75c577806a mwifiex: get rid of global save_adapter and sdio_work

but the clear_bit() calls were (before this patch) still useful for
other reasons.

But now, I don't think you need these clear_bit() calls any more --
you're totally destroying the card and its workqueue on remove(). (And
anyway, MWIFIEX_IFACE_WORK_CARD_RESET was just cleared by your caller.)

And...we're approximately back to where we were 4 years ago :)

    mwifiex: sdio: reset adapter using mmc_hw_reset

Anyway, assuming the "function reset" thing isn't workable, and you drop
the clear_bit() stuff, I think this is fine:
