Technically Page 49.  In the PDF you go to page 69, but the heading on
the top of the page says 49.

Technically it seems like things ought to be OK at the slow speed
since technically we're allowed to talk "high speed" at 400 kHZ (or at
any rate <= 52MHz).  ...but I guess I could also see some cards not
liking that.  Though I'm no expert, feel free to add my reviewed-by if
it is useful:
