Maybe wait before applying.  I've been running reboot tests now with
this patch applied (among others) and with enough reboots I managed to
see:

[    5.682418] rockchip-dp ff970000.dp: eDP link training failed (-5)

I'll see if I can confirm that it's this patch and why things are
different compared to downstream.
