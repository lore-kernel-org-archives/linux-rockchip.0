It means it is on an always-on power domain, so it will be always powered even
in suspend mode.

There are different clockevents on the SoC, the local timers (smp_twd) and the
rockchip timer. They are not used together, the local timers will be used as
default because they are per cpu. So the rockchip timer is not used in this case.

Then there is the situation when the cpu is powered down, the local timers,
which belongs to the same power domain, will be powered down also. If there is a
timer set for this CPU, an alternate, backup timer must be used, and that is the
rockchip timer. However this situation happens:

 - when a CPU is offlined. But the timers are moved to another CPU.
 - when the CPU enters a deep idle state. But such state does not exist on rk3188
 - when the system goes to suspend. But the timers are stopped in any case and
   CPU0 is always on.

There is no case when the rockchip timer is used for the clockevent.

If I'm not wrong, you can check /proc/interrupts and see there is no interrupt
on the rockchip timer.

So the board is typically a case where we want to use a clocksource from one IP
and the clockevents from another IP (just looping back with the clkevt macro
patch I answered a few minutes ago).

That does not call in question this patch as it describes the hardware.

I have to review the last 3 patches of the series. I will let you know for a V6.

Thanks.
