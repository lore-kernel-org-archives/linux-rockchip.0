My god!! let's forget it now!
Sorry for forgetting what happened.

Re-picked them up for my board since I'm doing other things to run a=20
single cpu.

localhost / # cat /proc/interrupts
            CPU0
   1:          0     GICv3  29 Edge      arch_timer
   2:        807     GICv3  30 Edge      arch_timer
   5:        712     GICv3 113 Level     rk_timer
