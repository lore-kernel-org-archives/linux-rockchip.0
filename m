I just thought it would be worth mentioning that I have picked &
tested a close to 60Hz mode on two veyron speedys of mine, but thought
it too much effort to try and upstream, especially as it was done as a
change to the actual panel info:
https://github.com/urjaman/linux/commit/23d46278911e18df138b7adde1bebc23f606baae

The difference would be in this format just setting hfront-porch = 87
and vback-porch = 14.
Anyways the point is: I support moving this mode info into the dts,
and I'd like to know how if at all should i go about getting a
60Hz(ish) mode upstreamed?
