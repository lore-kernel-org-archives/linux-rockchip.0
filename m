I think this is somewhat ambiguous. One could argue that panels only
have a fixed mode. What you means if obviously the fixed DRM display
mode, but that's not something that should go into the binding. I'd
simply drop this requirement.

This is the important bit and kind of obsoletes the above anyway. Oh,
and you probably meant "... provide at _least_ one..."

bnode

The properties for display timings in DT don't list anything other than
the 'typ' values, right? I'm not sure I understand this requirement.

> + - You must provide all required properties for the panel-timing subnode

Isn't this redundant? required properties are always required.

Other than the unclarities, the above does reflect what we had discussed
on IRC. I wonder, though, how much of this really belongs in the device
tree bindings. The above are almost all restrictions that apply to the
driver, and are very specific to Linux. Perhaps this is something that
belongs in the GPU documentation rather than DT bindings. They are more
like guidelines for what panel drivers should look like rather than what
the DT should look like.
