The wording is a bit confusing, but I think Shawn intended for:
(a) if no property is provided, default to the maximum supported (i.e.,
    gen2), to keep backward compatibility
(b) if a property is provided, but it doesn't contain 1 or 2, just
    default to 1

I already disagreed with (b) (and suggested we make this an error
instead; we have no business accepting malformed device trees here IMO).
Alternatives to clear up the confusion Rob pointed out might include:
(1) explaining this better (i.e., what does "otherwise" mean in the
    original sentence?)
(2) changing this to uniformly default to 2 (if someone used an
    unsupported value, treat it as if the property wasn't there at all)
(3) reject incorrect values outright (so we don't have this fuzzy middle
    ground at all)

> Let's drop rockchip and make this a common property. 

As in, handle this in some generic/common way? AFAICT, there's really
no way to do that given the current structure of PCIe handling (and the
nature of these kinds of limitations).

Or, do you just mean make the name common? (i.e,. "max-link-speed"
instead of "rockchip,max-link-speed")

Also for the record, Shawn already sent v5 before your comments.
Presumably he'll need a v6 then...
