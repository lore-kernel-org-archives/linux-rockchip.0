Just a note that I have since found out that recent patches in the
kernel in fact _do_ init the drive phase and apparently do it
improperly.  That means that $SUBJECT patch actually is expected to
fix real problems on real devices.

See <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9085311/> for some details.
