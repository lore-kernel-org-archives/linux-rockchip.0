That's not quite correct. The reason why we need the information in DT
is because it can't be derived from anything else. It is board-specific
data for which there's no heuristic that will work in all cases.

Yes, I think clk-pwm is very special in this regard because the period
can be derived from the requested clock rate. It would be complicated to
implement DT parsing that ignores parts of the specifier in some cases
but not in others. Simply having the clk-pwm driver ignore whatever is
in the table (or perhaps bail out on periods other than 0 for example).

I don't think this gains us much. The above would work for pwm-regulator
and pwm-fan, in both cases it'd replace a single line with two lines and
fitting the expressions into function arguments is likely going to be
hideous. For leds-pwm this wouldn't work, because of the low-active case
that it supports.

I reached the same conclusion in another subthread. If hardware readout
isn't supported, I think the most natural thing to do is simply use the
initial state (i.e. what's defined in DT or board files) instead. There
is an argument, I think, to be made for having users apply the initial
state at probe time to forcibly apply the logical state to hardware and
subsequently not care about the initial state anymore. For most cases
that might not even be necessary, though.
