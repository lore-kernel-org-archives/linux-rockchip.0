The "host1" port (AKA the dwc2 port that isn't the OTG port) on rk3288
has a hardware errata that causes everything to get confused when we get
a remote wakeup.  We'll use the reset that's in the CRU to reset the
port when it's in a bad state.

Note that we add the reset to both dwc2 controllers even though only one
has the errata in case we find some other use for this reset that's
unrelated to the current hardware errata.  Only the host port gets the
quirk property, though.

This patch came from Doug Anderson <dianders@chromium.org> originally.
