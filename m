The mapping of legacy PCIe INTx interrupts onto wired system
interrupts is a property of the PCIe host controller, not of a
particular PCIe device. So I would argue that the code is broken here
as well: it should never attempt to interpret 'interrupt' properties
at the PCI device level as having any bearing on how legacy interrupts
are routed.
