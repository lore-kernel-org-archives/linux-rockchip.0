Agree. Moreover we need that API to also pick the closest value to
target, when trying the range "target->minimum". I also believe it
would be good to allow both upper and lower limits to be zero.

If Mark disagrees with this approach, we will have to deal with all
the magic inside the mmc core layer. Very much similar how
mmc_regulator_get_ocrmask() is implemented.

Kind regards
