It will be called after rockchip_pcie_init_port for phy to disable
the unused lanes.

yes, pcie drivers support up to 4 lanes. But the device may only
support x2. This is beyound the awareness of PCIe controller, so pcie
controller can't tell which one(s) should be turned off.

As I say above, even we have 4 phy objects, PCIe controller still
doesn't know which one(s) to be turned off, so you have to call 4 times
phy_power_off if I understand it correctly. This doesn't look
okay to me.
