While it's not sensible for an i2c command to _actually_ need more
than 200ms to complete, let's increase the timeout anyway.  Why?  It
turns out that if you've got a large number of printks going out to a
serial console, interrupts on a CPU can be disabled for hundreds of
milliseconds. That's not a great situation to be in to start with
(maybe we should put a cap in vprintk_emit()) but it's pretty annoying
to start seeing unexplained i2c timeouts.

A normal system shouldn't see i2c timeouts anyway, so increasing the
timeout should help people debugging without hurting other people
excessively.
