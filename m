I'm not sure what is not working here exactly. We emit all the
compatible strings in the uevent. However, it looks like this is only
called for platform devices. In the case of i2c, I don't think any
compatible string is emitted. It looks to me like i2c_device_uevent
just needs a call to of_device_get_modalias to fix this. There's some
issues in the I2C core in how it does matching and maybe this is
related? I would guess if it was that easy, then it would be fixed
already. Maybe not.

TBC, from a DT perspective (and what the binding should say), is the
properties are only valid with a wacom compatible present (or any
others you want to add). If the driver doesn't enforce that and
supports having those properties with just "hid-over-i2c", then
downstream dts's can use that for all I care.
