I'm thinking having it separately is more clear and modular.

The clients could or could not request the mode via DT. Every PWM chip registers
supported modes at driver probe (default, if no PWM mode support is added
to the PWM chip driver the PWM chip will supports only normal mode). If a
PWM channel is requested by a PWM client via DT, and there is no PWM mode setting
in DT bindings, e.g. requested with these bindings:
pwms=<pwm-controller pwm-channel pwm-period> or
pwms=<pwm-controller pwm-channel pwm-period pwm-flags>
the first available mode of PWM chip will be used to instantiate the mode.
If the defined modes are:
PWM_DTMODE_NORMAL=0x1
PWM_DTMODE_COMPLEMENTARY=0x2
PWM_DTMODE_PUSH_PULL=0x4
and the PWM chip driver registers itself, at probe, with (PWM_DTMODE_COMPLEMENTARY | PWM_DTMODE_PUSH_PULL)
then the first available mode will be PWM_DTMODE_COMPLEMENTARY (first LSB bit
of the variable that keeps the available modes).

Yes, I think this could be accomplished. Here I took into account only PWM controller
capabilities. Having this, I think will involve having extra PWM bindings describing
extra capabilities per-channel. And to change a little bit the implementation in order
to have these capabilities per channel nor per PWM controller. What do you think? 

I think push-pull mode could also be accomplished having board inverter and delay
modules. So, in these cases make sense to have per channel capabilities, as per my
understanding. 

Thank you,
