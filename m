I understand, that you prefer a HW-specific name for a property
over one, that explains the actual effect.
However, using disable-<feature> (which is always a directive for the driver
and not a HW description) is not uncommon:

* disable-wp should be "no-wp-line-connection"
* disable-over-current -> "no-over-current-line-connection"
* srp-disable -> "not-existing-srp-implementation"
* ...

But I don't mind using something else.
Would "broken-cqe-dcmd" (like broken-cd or broken-flash-reset) be ok?
Or other suggestions?

Also I'd like to mention, that my first implementation was "supports-cqe-dcmd".
I guess that would be a good choice, if it would have been there
from the beginning. Introducing it now, would silently disable DCMD
for existing DTBs. Therefore I went on to "disable-cqe-dcmd".

So mmc.txt lists "standardised" names for properties to reduce the risk
of having similar, but distinct names for different MMC drivers.
So whenever you want to introduce a new property for a driver,
check if there isn't already something defined in mmc.txt.

When seeing it this way, it clearly makes sense to have the property there.

Thanks,
Christoph
