Hi Doug,

Sorry for bringing this up, but there used to be an issue with retuning 
in general, ie. the device handled tuning command 19 only once after 
startup. I guess that is no longer an issue given your results. I guess 
the problem goes away when you disable device sleep functionality. No 
what you want in terms of power consumption, but would be good to know. 
You can disable it with below patch.

Regards,
Arend
