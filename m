     Have some discussion with my colleague, we decided remove the"=20
maskrom" mode in next version.
   Actually, this mode is not so used so often.
     But "reboot loader" is frequently used  in development by all the=20
rockchip platform related people, even
some widely used factory tools use this command.So we really hope it ca=

compatible with the existing tools
and user experience.
