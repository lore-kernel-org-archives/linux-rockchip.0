Can you and Jianqun Xu please coordinate?  Though I don't have a TRM
for rk3399 and I haven't looked through this whole patch, I know for
sure there's a problem when I pick the latest patch series from both
of you it doesn't compile.

I believe this is the latest from each of you in patchwork:

8462411   [v3,1/3] dt-bindings: add bindings for rk3399 clock controller
8462431   [v3,2/3] clk: rockchip: add dt-binding header for rk3399
8462441   [v3,3/3] ARM64: dts: rockchip: add core dtsi file for rk3399

8463741   [RESEND,v2,1/5] clk: rockchip: add more mux parameters for
new pll sources
8463801   [RESEND,v2,2/5] clk: rockchip: Add support for multiple
clock providers
8463771   [RESEND,v2,3/5] clk: rockchip: add new pll-type for rk3399
and similar socs
8463781   [RESEND,v2,4/5] clk: rockchip: add a COMPOSITE_FRACMUX_NOGATE type
8463831   [RESEND,v2,5/5] clk: rockchip: add clock controller for the RK3399


Specifically your patch from March 1st refers to SCLK_SDMMC_DRV and
SCLK_SDMMC_SAMPLE.  Those defines existed in Jianqun Xu's patch back
on Feb 19th <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8355411/>, but his
latest patch series from March 1st
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8462431/> no longer has those
#defines.

Can you two resolve this so I can pick both patch series and see that
they compile?  ...or let me know where I messed up, of course.

Thanks!
