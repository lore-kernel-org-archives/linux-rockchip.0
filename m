Did anyone ever come up with an acceptable solution for this?  After
three years, I'm getting tired of rebasing these patches onto every new
kernel.

UUIDs or similar are NOT an option for multiple reasons:

- We have two rootfs partitions for ping-pong updates, so simply
  referring to "the thing with ID foo" doesn't work.

- Installing said updates needs direct access the device/partition,
  which may not even have a filesystem.

- The u-boot environment is stored in an eMMC "boot" partition, and
  userspace needs to know where to find it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one in a similar situation.

Russel, feel free to shout abuse at me.  I don't care, but it makes you
look stupid.
