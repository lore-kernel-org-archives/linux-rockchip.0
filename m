OK.

I'm not suggesting increasing the timeout, exactly; I'm suggesting that
you should set some minimum timeout for each training loop, instead of
reusing the same deadline. i.e., something like this before the second
loop:

	/* Reset the deadline for gen2 */
	timeout =3D jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(500);

As it stands, if the first loop takes 490 ms, that leaves you only 10 m=
s
for the second loop. And I think it'd be confusing if we ever see the
first loop take a "long" time, and then we time out on the second --
we'd be blaming the gen2 training for gen1's slowness.

OK. Well maybe the text should say something like "falling back" instea=

of "force"?

OK.
