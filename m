Just to clarify, in my case commit 7c5209c315ea didn't make the
problem worse, but made it better.  Just not better enough.  ;)

Quite honestly just dealing with the HLE error (my patch or
equivalent) might be a sane solution for the problem you describe.

dw_mmc needs to be able to work with an external card detect GPIO.
It's been part of the dw_mmc driver for a long time and is (in fact)
in use upstream at least by rk3288-veyron.  Any solution that only
works for internal card detect is not enough.  Just handling the HLE
error to deal with the interrupt storm and then letting Linux remove
the card (because of the card detect interrupt) seems totally OK to
me.

Note: I'd be very curious if your problems get better if you disable
the "grf_force_jtag" bit in the GRF.  If you're using the builtin card
detect and you use the boot default of "grf_force_jtag" then your pins
will be unmuxed behind your back when the card is ejected.  This could
be causing the dw_mmc controller to get confused.


> And another question: should we wait busy for cmd13?

I don't think so.  As I understand it CMD13 uses only the CMD line for
communication and it should be appropriate to send this when the bus
is "busy" (which means that the DATA lines are low).

Also: it seems odd that the HLE IRQ storm didn't come right after the
CMD 13 in your description above.  Are you sure it was the CMD 13 that
caused the HLEs, or could it has been something else?
