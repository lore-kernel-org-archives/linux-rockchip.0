I build locally when I apply and if there is a dependency on fixes,
cover letter mentioning, I do merge fixes.
So not sure from a process pov where the gap might be.

Builders are helpful for review and checking sanity :-)

I would say it would be helpful, if it was split. I can pick fixes now
and get that in for rc. While the rest can go into next
