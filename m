There is no known problem fixed.  I've been looking at HDMI and
controlling PLL jitter is an important part of supporting HDMI clock
rates.  That got me to looking at this parameter and deciding that we
should set it correctly.  Apparently it doesn't help in any hugely
significant way...  I just got done re-testing a whole lot of rates
and if it helped or hurt my jitter it's in the noise (AKA there's
enough variance run-to-run that it's hard to tell if this made any
difference).
