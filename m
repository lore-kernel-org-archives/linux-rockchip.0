Your original two arguments don't really stand up.

Let's take #2 to start with.

You claim that coreboot doesn't have support to provide the correct UUID.
Why is that a problem?  Distros on x86 don't have support to provide the
correct UUID either.  That's done by the distro when setting the system
up - it provides the kernel loader (eg, grub) with an appropriate
configuration, which includes a root specifier with the correct UUID,
eg:

 root=UUID=a5dcd879-eea2-4d87-bdef-8ee76741e7df

That's for the initramfs to use, but there's a short UUID equivalent for
the kernel itself, or as Rob and myself have already pointed out, the
label system (which is problematical if you have multiple filesystems
with the same label.)  UUID is the better system.

For #1, are you really saying that you're somehow different from all the
x86 platform users, and can't cope with dynamic numbering of devices that
are present on x86 systems?

Except the problem is already solved by the UUID or label mount methods,
which work everywhere, even across different media.  So, if you decide
to plug your SD card into a USB reader because the SD slot has become
unreliable, if you mount by UUID or label, the kernel will still find
the right device, even though it's now become /dev/sd* instead of
/dev/mmcblk*.

*Sigh* you're taking this to an extreme.  Random numbering isn't a goal
in itself.  The kernel just doesn't provide a _guarantee_ the order in
which devices appear or the names which the devices will get.

It means that you _can_ mount by device path if you wish, but you may
occasionally run into cases where the device path changes for one
reason or another (eg, because you've changed the PCIe card slot that
your SATA PCIe card is plugged into, or many other reasons.)

Just use UUID (preferred) or label and enjoy much more flexibility than
your solution adding yet more code to the kernel would give you.
