Right now this patch puts your clock into the rk3399.dtsi, which is the
wrong place. On most Rockchip systems, the xin32k clock is created
by the pmic (rk808 in a lot of cases) and the clock-tree gets amended
once the pmic has probed. See for example [0].

While I don't know where your xin32k really comes from (cros-ec maybe)
it is definitly a board-specific source for the clock and should thus
live in the rk3399-gru.dtsi.

And we really expect each board to actually make sure its xin32k is
properly defined as for example on the rk808 and act8846 pmics it could
also very well be turned off at boot and also does support multiple rates,
thus needing proper clock handling.
