Brain posted the below patches for upstream.

That make sense to improve efficiency

Caesar post the below patches for upstream.

That will fixes some issues in special cases.

Anyway, this series patches should can improve the rockchip thermal driver.


Changes in v3:
- fix trivial thing for error message nd return value.
- change the commit.
- Fixes something as Brian comments on

Changes in v2:
- As Brian commnets that restructure this to pass error codes back to the
  upper layers.
- Improve the commit message.
- improve the commit as Brian commnets on https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9440985
- Fixes something as Brian comments on
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9440989.

Changes in v1:
- The original Brian posted on https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9437686
  Note: it'd probably be even nicer to know which sensor this was, but we've
  kinda abstracted that one away by this point...
- The original Brian posted on https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9437687
