Another idea based on my RFC patches to make pci_host_bridge the primary
structure for probing PCI: we could split out the old 'bus::pci_ops' with
the traditional read/write interface from a new structure that becomes
pci_host_bridge::pci_host_bridge_ops, and also contains the other callbacks
that we recently added to pci_ops, alongside type0/type1 accessors.

We could then have a set of default pci_ops that call
pci_host_bridge_ops->type0_read/type0_write/type1_read/type1_write,
and those in turn get a pci_host_bridge as an argument along with the
bus, device, function and register numbers instead of bus pointer
and devfn/where.

This way all existing code can keep working, but we can convert host
drivers (if desired) to provide only pci_host_bridge_ops and no
pci_ops, while making it easier to define those with a more modern
interface.
