That's good and I'm happy when that works, but it doesn't work in the
general case. I'm not saying you can't do exactly the same thing here.
All I'm asking for is add the properties to the binding AND a
compatible. The kernel can ignore the added compatible. The key point
is if you have additional properties outside of what it means to be
HID-over-I2C, then you must have a compatible for that device. Whether
you enforce that in the driver, I don't give a shit. I do care how it
is documented though and will care when or if we start validating
bindings (I don't think that's the kernel's job).

This is not just a problem with probe-able buses. This dual sourcing
happens with non-probe-able devices too. Look at Hans' series for
Allwinner tablet touchscreens.

If SD slots were the primary target for SDIO cards, we'd be in much
better shape without all the misc side band signals. Many devices I
don't think could be made to work as a card.

We have ways to deal with board specifics. If you want something
completely generic to handle any possible power sequence of any board
and any device, then propose something that does that. That's not what
we have here with 2 properties.
