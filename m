It sort of resumes, barfs about missing interrupts, various timeouts
from the VOP and thermal sensors, and finally locks up. Not exactly
usable. Either applying this patch or reverting 981ed1bfbc makes it
behave again.

Would you mind posting this patch? I'm happy to give it a go on my setup.

How reassuring! ;-)

OK. So this patch is definitely the wrong thing to do.

Thanks for all the context, much appreciated.
