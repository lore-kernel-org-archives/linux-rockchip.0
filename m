I've never used labels.  I can take a look at them.  I presume I'll
have to do a little extra work to tag my "emmc" filesystem properly
when I install to eMMC, but that wouldn't be too bad.  Thanks for the
suggestion.

That solves point #2, but not point #1.  It still adds an extra step
of mapping number to device when looking at logs / sysfs files.

IMHO:

* this patch set is very small.

* this patch set doesn't hurt anyone.

* I believe lots of people feel that this patch set would be useful.

* this patch set is very small and shouldn't be too hard to maintain.

* the MMC maintainer, who would be responsible for dealing with the
code in the future if any problems come up, seem to be OK with it.

It would be quite easy to adjust this to other systems if they
provided similar functionality.  Nearly 100% of this code is just
calling helper functions, so the code would be easy to find and change
if/when there was a generic (non-DT) method for this.

As far as it being MMC specific: it's not.  Do a "git grep" for
of_alias_get_id().  It's used in many, many places.

Can you provide documentation that this is a non-goal?  I can submit
some patches upstream to make ID allocation behave more randomly if
that would be helpful to upstream.  I'd probably want to disable it
locally, but if you think folks would really like it...  ;)

In all seriousness, though, I'm not sure why randomness in IDs would
be considered a worthwhile goal.  Is it because:

* You're trying to discourage people from building systems where they
hardcode "/dev/mmcblk0" as the eMMC?  Maybe it would be better to
throw a big WARN_ON in the boot log for this?

* You think that numbering like this doesn't scale somehow?  Note that
for a given piece of hardware it's quite likely to have a small number
of MMC slots and it's quite likely that users of this SoC can agree on
the numbering (emmc = 0, SD slots start at 1).

* Some other reason?
