I didn't phrase that very well.  There's certainly value in stressing
the bind/unbind paths, but I thought the primary reason you wrote this
was to fix the fact that you could crash the system like this:

  # echo f8000000.pcie > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/rockchip-pcie/unbind
  # lspci

From my point of view, that's the issue that *has* to be fixed.
Better test coverage is icing.

It sounds like several drivers have that same issue, and the simplest
possible fix is to set .suppress_bind_attrs, so I suggested doing that 
so it's easy to analyze the tree as a whole and say "these drivers
all have the same problem, and all the fixes look the same."

I guess if you'd rather skip that for Rockchip and apply a more
complicated fix there, I could go along with that.  But I don't think
it would hurt anything to set .suppress_bind_attrs, then remove it
when you add module support.  The concepts of .suppress_bind_attrs and
modularity are related, and doing this in a separate patch would make
it a nice example to follow if somebody wants to make other drivers
modular as well.

It's not so much a question of using the Rockchip change as a stick.
I'm just thinking that it makes a more logical progression to fix the
more important issue globally first.

Yeah, you're right, I had in my head the idea that if we've identified
the same problem in several drivers, we should fix them all, but I
neglected to turn that into words.
