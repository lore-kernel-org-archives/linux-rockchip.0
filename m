Don't think I'm going to follow URLs - I don't use a desktop mail
client, and as I'm several days behind with email, I don't have time
to go looking through a crappy pipermail web archive at the moment
either.

Anyway, why can't we use the priority system for clocksources?  If
ARM GT is problematical, we need a way to register it with a lower
priority than the preferred time keeping source.  That's exactly
what the clocksource priority field is for.
