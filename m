Well, they're kinda two sides of the same coin; I was wanting to test
the bind path, and when I tried this, I noticed that I could trivially
crash the system. The crash seemed like a more important thing to
document (because otherwise, it just looks like I'm adding a feature).

I didn't really view messing with /sys/.../unbind as a big issue,
outside of development and testing (there's a lot of damage a malicious
actor can do with unconstrained access to /sys/), so I guess I didn't
put that aspect as super-high priority. If you'd like to prioritize
that, then I'm OK with that.

Sure, that is the simplest approach.

I'll leave that up to you, and I can resubmit things if desired. As you
have since noticed, I already sent a patch to add .suppress_bind_attrs
to all the other drivers. If you'd like, feel free to add
pcie-rockchip.c into that mix, it's not hard -- or I can redo it myself.
Then I can modify and resend (or you can do the trivial modification
required to) the current patch set.

Just let me know.

Sure, I can grok that. Just let me know if you want any more action from
me.
