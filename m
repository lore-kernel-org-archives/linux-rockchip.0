There are properties which never make sense with ACPI, and there are
drivers which shouldn't exist in the case of ACPI (due to clashes with
core ACPI functionality). So using of_property_* for those, and not
matching any ACPI tables is perfectly fine.

IMO, an of_property_read_s32_index() function is perfectly fine (as is
an ACPI-specific variant, or a unified helper, if that's useful to some
driver).

There is no need to force drivers to superficially appear to support
ACPI when they have not been designed with ACPI in mind, and are
unlikely to function in an ACPI environment.

Thanks,
Mark.
