I probably won't have time to look at this any time soon, but when I
saw this patch fly by I was a little hesitant because:

* Not all PLL settings produce the same jitter.  On rk3288 I spent
loads of time searching for PLL settings that would be low jitter
enough to make a pixel clock that was happy with lots of different TVs
/ monitors.  It's true that there were certain heuristics that could
be followed but certainly my predictions didn't always match what
happened.

* Depending on what's using the PLL, you might want very different
settings.  One can optimize for lock time, power usage, jitter,
accuracy, etc.  For instance for a CPU clock that you change a lot you
probably don't care about hitting an exact frequency and you probably
don't care overly much about jitter, but you want low lock times.  For
HDMI you don't care about lock times and and probably don't care about
power usage, but you care about meeting an exact clock and really
really care about jitter.

* I know that in the past the way I found to make some of the best
rates for HDMI was to have the PLL make a rate that was several times
what I wanted and then activate a divider later in the clock tree.
That gave me the best jitter / clock accuracy.  I have no idea how to
do that automatically, but in the past I relied on the PLL only having
a fixed set of rates it could make so it would fail to make the lower
clock rate (higher jitter) and eventually end up with the better one.


Anyway, I don't know how to solve all of the above, but I just wanted
to bring it up as a concern.
