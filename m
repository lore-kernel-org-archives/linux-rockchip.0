Hrm, this gets into the whole issue of coming up with generic names.
It's not always easy, especially when marketing gets involved.  If
Synopsis comes up with a new APB UART that's not compatible, I guess
you call it a v2 and people just need to figure out which one they
have?  I remember it being terribly confusing with exynos since
Samsung called things "exynos" that were very different, and I think
even "exynos5" devices were pretty different form each other.  Anyway,
that's getting pretty far afield.

The general way of doing things in Linux is that the first driver
there becomes the generic, right?  So if the first supported SoC using
this PHY was rk3288 then it gets the name and becomes the generic.  If
rk3066a and 3188 are 90% the same and initially can actually use the
same driver, then they specify the specific "3188" and the generic
"3288" as a fallback.  It sounds like that was what was actually done
in the DTS files anyway, which is right as far as I'm concerned.

...but personally I'd love to see it documented.  ...someone reading
the binding should be able to create a DTS and it's not obvious from
the DTS that "rk3288" is the generic as far as this binding is
concerned.

Quite honestly, though, it's not terribly important to me and
definitely not something I feel like I can make a call on.  If you
feel strongly about keeping it the way you have it and nobody else has
any objections, I won't yell.
