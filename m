Where, exactly? Do you have a suggested property name?

Regarding compatible-based approach (from prior email): we do heavily
use the top-level 'compatible' property too for a similar purpose, but
sometimes there's a useful difference between "I booted with DTB
<foo>, which is compatible with revision X, Y, Z, ..." and "the exact
revision I booted is N". So the properties are definitely useful.

Well, we ain't changing the old firmware. Coming up with a new name
can work, and we can modify new firmware to start doing both. But it'd
still probably be wise to note what's actively in-use, especially if
it's not substantively different than what we settle on.
