ome drivers are briefly preparing+enabling the clock in their
->probe() hook and disable+unprepare them before leaving the function.

This can be problem if a clock is shared between different devices, and
one of these devices is critical to the system. If this clock is
enabled/disabled by a non-critical device before the driver of the
critical one had a chance to enable+prepare it, there might be a short
period of time during which the critical device is not clocked.

To solve this problem, we save the initial clock state (at registration
time) and prevent the clock from being disabled until kernel init is done
(which is when clk_disable_unused() is called).
