This patch series updates the Synopsys Designware DisplayPort bridge
together with the only existing user: The Rockchip RK3576/RK3588:

 1. Follow-up bridges (PHY, USB-C connector)
    This is needed to get USB-C DP AltMode working; I've followed
    the Qualcomm driver as reference

 2. Runtime PM
    The initial driver has been upstreamed without RPM; add it to
    avoid wasting power when nothing is plugged

 3. Audio
    The initial driver has been upstreamed without audio support;
    this adds all missing bits for audio with single stream transport

To properly make use of the bridge code the following USBDP PHY series
is also needed:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260714-rockchip-usbdp-cleanup-v13-0-6cb3e769d4c5@collabora.com/

This series can be applied without the USBDP side. In that case USB-C
support won't work as the mainline USBDP side does not register as a
DRM bridge. As upstream DT binding for USBDP does not yet support
proper ports, no such board should be upstream.

Boards using the DP controller for native DP connectors (or HDMI
bridges), currently directly link to the connector/hdmi bridge. These
are not affected by the USBDP changes and should keep working in any
case. The difference is, that this series the DRM side is aware of the
link. I don't have any of those boards, so this code path is untested.

I added a dedicated bridge callback for out-of-band hotplug events,
which is separate from the hotplug_notify. I have a feeling, that
there might be a better solution, but haven't found it. Please comment.

Changes in v8:
- Link to v7: https://patch.msgid.link/20260728-synopsys-dw-dp-improvements-v7-0-b7640fa8cf48@collabora.com
- Add new patch moving DP AUX bridge registration into
  bridge_attach/detach callbacks, which simplifies cleanup and ensures
  it is (un)registered at the right point in time (Sashiko)
- Update Fix incorrect resource lifetimes in bind callback patch to
  ensure at the end of the probe, the device is fully functional,
  also only register the bridge once all necessary bits are available
  as it is in theory reachable at this point (Sashiko)
- Update the patch cancelling HPD worker to simply use
  devm_work_autocancel() as a result of this rework
- Add a new patch describing why the reset line state is not explicitly
  changed (Sashiko)
- Merge the two patches for the AUX transfer timeout handling to avoid a
  temporary race condition and synchronize IRQs after the reset to fix
  yet another race condition (Sashiko)
- Add a new patch to properly support short I2C reads (Sashiko)
- Rework Runtime PM handling again, so that the OOB handling is done
  before the 100ms sleep. Also ensure it is enabled at the right point
  in time after the cleanup changes. (Sashiko)
- Add new patch to drop useless reservation for SDP slot 0, which
  fix a race condition (Sashiko)
- Also restore audio mute status when audio functionality is restored
  after atomic disable/enable cycle (Sashiko)
- Setup SDP audio frame channel_allocation according to information
  received from ALSA (Sashko)
- Sashiko feedback ignored by me and that may or may not appear again
  in this version as Sashiko does not seem to properly take the whole
  series into account and thus probably ignores the changelog
  * A divide-by-zero vulnerability exists in dw_dp_video_enable when
    processing a display mode with a clock value of 1; I believe this
    clock cannot drive a real mode
  * I2C-over-AUX reply status (NACK/DEFER) is silently discarded,
    causing deferred I2C transactions to falsely succeed and return
    garbage data; this is a false positive. It seems Sashiko got
    confused by the bit patterns. Nothing is discarded.
  * Potential Use-After-Free of the connector and encoder due to missing
    DRM device reference in OOB hotplug event handling; Sashiko
    missed that drm_for_each_bridge_in_chain() is now the renamed
    drm_for_each_bridge_in_chain_scoped().
  * Missing runtime PM acquisition in out-of-band HPD callbacks leads to
    SError crashes once runtime PM is enabled; Sashiko failed to
    notice that Runtime PM is only introduced in a later patch
  * Calling a sleeping function (msleep) from a runtime PM resume
    callback that is reachable from an atomic commit path; Sashiko
    failed to understand that atomic DRM functions may sleep
  * Missing system sleep callbacks prevent the device and its power
    domain from suspending during system sleep for native DP
    configurations; this needs separate investigation considering
    system sleep is broken on recent Rockchip platforms (same error
    appears a few times)
  * There is a bunch of pre-existing issues that are fixed later
    in the series

Changes in v7:
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260724-synopsys-dw-dp-improvements-v6-0-041d99a19c4e@collabora.com
- Move drm_bridge_add() to probe and only attach it in the bind
  function, as the object is re-used and not fully cleared by
  drm_bridge_remove (Sashiko)
- Add a new patch resetting the DP AUX sub-controller on message
  timeout to have decent error recovery (Sashiko)
- Fix dp_dp_rockchip_get_vo_grf -> dw_dp_rockchip_get_vo_grf (Sashiko)
- Introduce pm_active in the PM runtime patch, to early exit
  on atomic_disable when atomic_enable failed to get runtime
  PM enabled (Sashiko)
- Introduce drm_bound in the PM runtime patch, which is (un)set
  when the driver is bound to a DRM encoder and used to enable
  IRQ enabling in the runtime PM handlers. This in turn protects
  the system of potential spurious interrupts. (Sashiko)
- In the audio patch, fix support for hotplug with a running
  audio stream. (Sashiko)
- To avoid further blowing up the series, I've decided not to
  act on these "pre-existing" issues reported by Sashiko. I
  think it makes sense to handle them separately:
    * Short HPD and Long HPD events share a single boolean state
      variable, causing critical hot plug events to be lost if
      interrupts arrive in quick succession.
    * DP AUX lifetime complains (registered too early / unregistered
      too late); reported multiple times
    * The driver fails to support DP AUX short reads, incorrectly
      rejecting them with -EBUSY instead of returning the number
      of bytes successfully transferred, which breaks I2C-over-AUX.
- Collected Reviewed-by from Krzysztof Kozlowski on the
  DT binding patch

Changes in v6:
- Link to v5: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260724-synopsys-dw-dp-improvements-v5-0-9445c2e87441@collabora.com
- Fix overlong commit message in mutex patch
- Update MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED patch, to use input format as output format
  when output format is MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED (Sashiko)
- Drop patch moving dw_dp_bridge_atomic_get_output_bus_fmts (no longer
  needed)
- Reword the comment about platforms other than RK3576 and RK3588
  shouldn't get the VO GRF from the USBDP to make it more obvious
  that no such platform exist at the moment and thus the alternative
  path will not be implemented at this point in time (Sashiko)
- Update the runtime PM code to have much better error handling
  as well as support for platforms not using runtime PM (Sashiko)
- Update the runtime PM code to keep the device suspended when
  probed, but unbound as a nice side effect
- Fix error handling for dw_dp_audio_infoframe_send() in audio
  patch (Sashiko)
- Fix typo in sample width check in audio patch (Sashiko)
- Improve cleanup of SDP in audio patch (Sashiko)

Changes in v5:
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260721-synopsys-dw-dp-improvements-v4-0-f0f4a4ede712@collabora.com
- Add new patch to cancel pending HPD work on unbind (Sashiko)
- Add new patch to add missing mutex cleanups on module removal (Sashiko)
- Add new patch moving dw_dp_bridge_atomic_get_output_bus_fmts

  and instead use whatever works for the negotiated bandwidth (Sashiko)
- Add more error checking for runtime PM patches (Sashiko)
- Ensure runtime PM is held in interrupt handler (Sashiko)
- Fix usbc_mode logic inversion for runtime PM in unbind (Sashiko)
- Move sleep for HPD_HOT_PLUG from hotplug handler to runtime
  resume function; no need to sleep when runtime PM is kept
  active and runtime PM resume is a slow operation anyways. (Sashiko)
- Add new patch to protect sdp_reg_bank from concurrent access (Sashiko)
- Add new patch to use regmap_set_bits in dw_dp_send_sdp()
- Update DT binding patch to be all about the selected solution and
  mention the ABI break
- Clear SDP in the audio patch on unprepare (Sashiko)
- Add a comment, that only 1,2 or 8 channels are supported (Sashiko)
- Error out on unsupported sample_width (Sashiko)
- Fix missing error check for clock enable (Sashiko)

 - Add "Fix incorrect resource lifetimes in bind callback", which
   affects all following patches quite a bit (Sashiko)
 - Update "Add follow-up bridge support" to mention that fatal errors
   are fine (Sashiko)
 - Update "Add out-of-band HPD notify handler" to use
   drm_for_each_bridge_in_chain() instead of
   drm_for_each_bridge_in_chain_scoped() required after rebase to
   latest drm-misc-next
 - Add 100ms sleep in hpd detect functions after runtime resume in the
   "Add Runtime PM support" patch (Andy Yan)
 - Keep runtime PM enabled if DP is used without USB-C to avoid missing
   HPD signals in "Add Runtime PM support" patch (Andy Yan)
 - Update patch description of DT binding patch and drop RFC tag

   allows easy error handling (Sashiko)
 - Avoid updating audio_interface in the audio prepare function when
   an error related early exit happens (Sashiko)
 - Add error handling for clock prepare calls in audio prepare function
   (Sashiko)
