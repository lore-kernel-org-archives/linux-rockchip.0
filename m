And I suppose this means we'd fall under this paragraph?

    "However if the devices have dedicated interrupt as the wakeup source
    then they need to specify/identify the same using device specific
    interrupt name. In such cases only that interrupt can be used as wakeup
    interrupt."

We don't expect *any* interrupt to qualify as PCI WAKE#; so we should
still also document the interrupt name ("wake"?) in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt as Bjorn suggested, in
addition to using the 'wakeup-source' property documented there.
