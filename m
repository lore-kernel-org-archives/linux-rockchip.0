I'm using brcm wifi that using out-of-tree drivers.

Not really. The intention of using side-band int is that we could put
the host into low power mode(maybe with pd off), so that the wifi could
still works with Socs. And mostly, we don't need to keep the controller
on when in S3. The side-band io could be registered as a gpio interrupt
(wakeup source), and once the wifi chip need to communicate with Socs,
it could wakeup the system(of course sdio controller will be alive
then). Also, once using side-band interrupt, the interrupt service and
management should be done with the wifi function drivers. I'm pretty
sure that my at-hand drivers, for instance, brcm and realtek actually
do that.

Sorry, I didn't test the upstreamed wifi drivers but from the test of my
out-of-tree wifi drivers, there is no much difference.
