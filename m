Somewhere I've read something about keeping wifi associated to an ap during 
suspend which might be a candidate for such a distinction?

From reading Documentation/power/states.txt it looks like the boot-cpu is 
supposed to retain power in the suspend state. Although we also do not lose 
"operating state" in our suspend I guess?

So using the shallow suspend as standby sounds interesting, for the time when 
the deep suspend works too. If there is only one suspend state it 
automatically becomes the "mem"-state it seems.
