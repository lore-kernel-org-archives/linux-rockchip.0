Where in your driver do you actually handle this child node? I don't see
anything, but perhaps I'm missing something. I see how your earlier
revisions of this driver used of_get_next_child() to acquire the child
node, for use with irq_domain_add_linear(). But that's not in this
version...

These optional properties apply to the pcie node, not the interrupt
controller child, right? Seems like the subnode and its properties
should be last (i.e., the 'Optional Property' section should be above
'Interrupt controller child node').

I'm a little lost on this one, so forgive my ignorance; how did you
determine the last value in each entry (i.e., the 1, 2, 3, and 4 IRQ
numbers for pcie0_intc)? IIUC, those are supposed to represent indeces
into the IRQ status register found in the PCIe interrupt status
register, and so they should be 0-based (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3). And then
you'd have:

	interrupt-map = <0 0 0 1 &pcie0_intc 0>,
			<0 0 0 2 &pcie0_intc 1>,
			<0 0 0 3 &pcie0_intc 2>,
			<0 0 0 4 &pcie0_intc 3>;

But then, I never got this sub-node binding to work quite right, so I
may be missing something.

EDIT: ooh, I see what's going on! I'll comment on the driver as well,
but it looks like you're translating the register status to a HW IRQ
number with 'ffs(reg)', which yields a 1-based index. I think it is most
sensible to use a 0-based index (i.e., 'ffs(reg) - 1'). Now, that only
will work if you get the whole interrupt-map + interrupt-controller
thing right (i.e., using a subnode for the interrupt controller) --
otherwise, IRQ mapping might not work right. I suspect that's one reason
the original driver writer might have used 1-based indexing in the first
place.
