If we accept that pwm_apply_state should adapt its state argument that
would be ok for me, too. Then however we should make this consistent and
consider a deviation that is not reported there as a bug.

Note there are also more subtile problems. For example something like:

	def enable(self):
		state =3D pwm_get_state(self.pwm)
		state.duty_cycle *=3D 2
		pwm_apply_state(self.pwm, state)

	def disable(self):
		state =3D pwm_get_state(self.pwm)
		state.duty_cycle /=3D 2
		pwm_apply_state(self.pwm, state)

doesn't guarantee that the sequence enable(); disable(); is idempotent.
So my favourite would be to not modfies the caller's copy of state for
pwm_apply_state(). (Note, this doesn't necessarily have implications
about the semantik of the lowlevel driver callbacks.) Still
pwm_get_state() should work and yield the corrected settings.

Ah. Of course the lowlevel driver has to work with the capabilities of
the hardware. That is something we cannot get rid of. It's just a
question how we communicate this to the consumer.

Ack. My suggestion is that round_rate should do:

	if polarity is unsupported:
		polarity =3D !polarity
		duty_cycle =3D period - duty_cycle

	period =3D biggest supportable period <=3D requested period, 0 if no
		such period exists.

	duty_cycle =3D biggest supportable duty cycle <=3D requested
		duty_cycle, 0 if no such value exists

This would allow to let the consumer (or framework helper function)
decide which deviation is ok.

The problem is that it is hard to come up with a formalism to map "all
info" because there are so many different ways to prefer one
configuration over another. I believe we won't be able to design a sane
callback prototype that allows to map all use cases.
