I'm all for keeping compatibility as good as possible and that issue came
on the table way too often already ;-) . In the past it was essentially easy
to go with "just don't enable symbols" and not go down the nitty-gritty
detail route - because that whole mesh of different firmware combinations
gives me a headache ;-) [0]

So finally going through those possible affected variants gave me those
thoughts of "is there even an actual problem with existing boards?".
Especially wrt forward<->backwards compatibility.

Outcome is, I'm definitly not sure about myself, but also could not come
up with an actual scenario. But that compile-time testing of applying
DTBOs is way too great to pass up on :-)

[0] If just some vendor would directly work on upstream TF-A from the
beginning, instead of hacking up some half-decade old ATF  ... ;-)
