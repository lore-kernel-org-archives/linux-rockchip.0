We don't know what's main cause for HLE..But i also think it's relevant=
 to SW issue.
But we need to consider all possibilities..

I agreed.

To Disable clock, it sends cmd with update_clk_regs_only and wait_prvda=
ta_complete bit.
I think it's problem..(waiting for prvdata..)

If there are ongoing some data(read/write), then before disabling clock=
, waiting for completing previous data.
(But card was already removed, and it couldn't do anything.)
It's difficult to analyze the HLE..So After applying first, then we can=
 solve this problem, step by step.
