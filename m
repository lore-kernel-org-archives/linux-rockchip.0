On the rk3288 USB host-only port (the one that's not the OTG-enabled
port) the PHY can get into a bad state when a wakeup is asserted (not
just a wakeup from full system suspend but also a wakeup from
autosuspend).

We can get the PHY out of its bad state by asserting its "port reset",
but unfortunately that seems to assert a reset onto the USB bus so it
could confuse things if we don't actually deenumerate / reenumerate the
device.

We can also get the PHY out of its bad state by fully resetting it using
the reset from the CRU (clock reset unit) in chip, which does a more full
reset.  The CRU-based reset appears to actually cause devices on the bus
to be removed and reinserted, which fixes the problem (albeit in a hacky
way).

It's unfortunate that we need to do a full re-enumeration of devices at
wakeup time, but this is better than alternative of letting the bus get
wedged.
