which is the reason why renaming stuff makes everything just more complicated 
without providing additional value ;-) 

The first patch would go through the mfd-tree (if accepted by Lee and Acked by 
the other involved subsystem maintainers) which would then need a stable 
branch merged into the regulator tree - or after the first patch goes in you 
simply wait for a kernel release.

Normally I would expect the reasonable kernel developer to be able to simply 
read code, kconfig, docs stating the drivers being for rk808 and rk818 without 
getting "confused" by some structs mentioning the rk808.
