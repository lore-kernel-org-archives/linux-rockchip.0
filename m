I guess the implication (I'm speculating here) is that in most
existing cases, the WAKE# signal is fielded by an ACPI BIOS, which
knows how it's connected.  I suppose that would end up being turned
into an SCI that Linux already knows how to handle generically.

And further, that the non-ACPI drivers are relatively new and you're
the first attempt to use WAKE# with a non-ACPI PCI host driver?

If this setup could be done somewhere in PCIe common code, that would
be great.  We have so much copy and pasted code already, it'd be nice
to avoid adding more.  I don't know if this would fit in
pci_scan_root_bus_bridge(), doing something like dma_configure() does
to get hold of a struct platform_device * or a struct device * so you
could lookup the IRQ?

I'm sure they're harmless.  The point is that the cleanup should be
done near the failure, not in the caller of the caller of the function
where the failure was detected.  You have:

  rockchip_pcie_probe
    rockchip_pcie_parse_dt
      rockchip_pcie_setup_irq
        err = dev_pm_set_dedicated_wake_irq
        if (err)
          dev_err(...)

So you detect the error in rockchip_pcie_setup_irq(), but you clean up
from it in rockchip_pcie_probe(), which doesn't make sense because
rockchip_pcie_probe() doesn't do anything related to wakeup interupts.
