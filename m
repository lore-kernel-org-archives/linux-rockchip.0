I'd rather use devfreq::suspend_count to detect if the devfreq
component is suspended, since it gives us a better granularity than
panthor_device::pm::state.

When PANTHOR_DEVICE_PM_STATE_SUSPENDING is set, not all HW
components have been clocked/put out of reset. It's probably okay
for power domains, because those deps are described through device
links, and the dependencies are resumed by PM core before the
panthor PM hooks are called, but this is fragile, and that's another
reason I think we shouldn't rely on panthor_device::pm::state for that,
but on devfreq::suspend_count (or any other internal panthor_devfreq
state that tracks the panthor_devfreq component status).

If you return zero here, the new frequency is assumed to be applied,
and it messes up with the devfreq state (::previous_freq for instance)
that was set on devfreq_suspend_device(). If we assume that rate
changes should be rejected while we're suspended, this should probably
return an error.

There's another race between devfreq_suspend_device(), which will
restore the ::resume_freq, and a concurrent devfreq_update_target() call
that's here to set a new rate. Using devfreq::suspend_count won't help,
because this atomic is decremented before the resume_freq is applied,
and the devfreq lock is only taken around the devfreq_set_target() call.

Honestly, it feels like we're trying to address the problem at the wrong
level. I would expect governors to stop calling devfreq_update_target()
between the DEVFREQ_GOV_SUSPEND and DEVFREQ_GOV_RESUME events (which
should probably be sent before suspend_count is incremented and the
suspend freq is applied). And I'd also expect some kind of
locking/synchronization to prevent races between
devfreq_update_target() and devfreq_{suspend,resume}_device().
