Hi Bjorn,

One piece of information to add:

This part is where the first vendor seems to disagree. They claim that
because power is not switched off, PERST# can remain asserted or
deasserted -- whichever leads to least power consumption. (i.e., they
don't consider they need to follow the parts that describe "when
removing main power" (e.g., in S3) we must assert PERST#.
