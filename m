Can the jacks can each be an aux_dev?  The jack driver would create
the jack at probe time and register it with the card in aux_dev->init.
cht_bsw_max98090_ti.c is already doing something similar, although all
contained in the machine driver.

If the jack detection circuit is integrated with a full codec, then
the codec driver can also create the jack and register it with the
card.

Then simple-card can have an optional property to specify aux devs.  A
GPIO jack device could handle simple switch-based jack detection.
