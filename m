Oh yes, I remember that. I also remember that I had asked for the
re-use of "phy_power_on()" to be fixed:

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/aDne1Ybuvbk0AwG0@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

but that never happened... which makes me wonder whether we *shouldn't*
have applied "sensor101"'s patch until such a requested patch was
available. In my experience, this is the standard behaviour - as a
reviewer, you ask a contributor to do something as part of their
patch submission, and as long as their patch gets merged, they
couldn't give a monkeys about your request.

So, in future, I'm going to take the attitude that I will NAK
contributions if I think there's a side issue that the contributor
should also be addressing until that side issue is addressed.

This shouldn't be necessary, I wish this weren't necessary, and I wish
people could be relied upon to do the right thing, but apparently it is
going to take a stick (not merging their patches) to get them to co-
operate. More fool me for trusting someone to do something.

I now have a couple of extra patches addressing my point raised in
that email... which I myself shouldn't have had to write.
