Yea, our current jack detection code is quite rudimentary when it comes=
 to=20
writing generic code.

I think the proper way to support this is come up with the concept of j=
ack=20
detection providers and consumers. A component can register a jack dete=
ction=20
provider just like it can register a DAI. And then in the board driver =
you'd=20
just link the jack detection logic to the jack using the usual approach=
,=20
which is also used for DAIs (e.g. of node or device name). The core wou=
ld=20
then take care of calling a enable callback or whatever is required to =
setup=20
the jack detection logic in the driver.

This would also nicely solve the issue with the GPIO jack detectors, wh=
ere=20
we currently can't really handle -EPROBE_DEFER. The GPIO would be reque=
sted=20
by a jack detection provider which can request them before the card is=20
registered rather than having to do the requesting in the card's init c=
allback.
