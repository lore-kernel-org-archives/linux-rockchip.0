Happy to help, this stuff is really not that well document
unfortunately.

After submitting the patch i actually dived a bit deeper at how this
all hangs together.

The linux kernel checks for mac-address, local-mac-address and address
in the fdt node, in that order of preference. u-boot (at least recent
ones like you have), will set the mac-address property *if* it's
already defined but will always create the local-mac-address property
regardless.

So indeed practially, as you noticed, just setting the alias is enough.
I'm now just very confused about the intended meanings of the
properties, Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt doesn't
shed a lot of light on it:

- local-mac-address: array of 6 bytes, specifies the MAC address that=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0 was assigned to the network device;
- mac-address: array of 6 bytes, specifies the MAC address that was=C2=A0
=C2=A0 last used by the boot program; should be used in cases where the=
 MAC=C2=A0
=C2=A0 address assigned to the device by the boot program is different =
from=C2=A0
=C2=A0 the "local-mac-address"property;

So yeah, I'm not sure what the "correct" fix is. It's tempting to
indeed just leave out the mac-address property though :)
