It's not any disconnects, it is really when you unplug the device from

The main issue is
               compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3328-dwc3", "rockchip,rk3399-dwc3=
";

because:
(1) On the devicetree-side you declare that they are compatible which may
    or may not conflict with needed later changes
(2) On the kernel-driver-side with the current status the rk3328-dwc3
    will get ignored and rk3399-dwc3 used to bind to the generic dt-dwc3
    driver.
    From looking at the Rockchip code in the vendor kernel we may very well
    need a separate driver to handle the big issue which creates the issue
    which driver will bind to the dt-node. It will be either the generic one
    binding to the rk3399-dwc3 or the special one binding to rk3328-dwc3.
    And sadly it will probably depend on which module gets loaded first.

And devicetrees are supposed to be backwards compatible so a newer
kernel should keep working with an old devicetree.

A possible way forward would be to introduce a separate compatible for
rk3328 (both in the binding doc and the generic dwc3 driver), so that
we get only a
               compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3328-dwc3";

Which then even can move easily into a new driver if necessary without
causing issues for existing devicetrees.
