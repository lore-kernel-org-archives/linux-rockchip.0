I just did a count of the implementations of pci_ops: I found 107
instances of 'struct pci_ops', and 67 of them treat type0 and type1
access differently in some form.

I'd estimate that about half of them, or roughly a third of the total
instances would benefit from my change, if we were to do them again.
Clearly there is no need to change the existing code here when it works,
unless the benefit is very clear and the code is actively maintained.

In some cases, the difference is only that the root bus has a limited
set of devices that are allowed to be accessed, so there would
likely be no benefit of this, compared to e.g. yet another callback
that checks the validity.
Some other instances have type0 registers at a different memory location
from type1, some use different layout inside of that space, and some
are completely different.
