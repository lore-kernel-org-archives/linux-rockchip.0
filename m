Patch 1 firstly moves the whole Rockchip PCIe host driver from
drivers/pci/host to a new folder, driver/pci/rockchip/, and renames
pcie-rockchip.c to pcie-rockchip-host.c. It also updates the
Kconfig/Makefile etc, to repect this change.

Then patch 2 and patch 3 are trying to spilt out some common code in
preparation for adding endponit controller driver support.

Patch 4 rename rockchip-pcie.txt to rockchip-pcie-host.txt and update
the compatible of_device_id. To keep the backward compatibility for
old dtb, we add new "rockchip,rk3399-pcie-host". That means DT uses
"rockchip,rk3399-pcie" would be bound to host controller driver by
default.

Patch 5 adds endpoint controller driver support as well as the new
documentation, rockchip-pcie-ep.txt, introduced by patch 6.
