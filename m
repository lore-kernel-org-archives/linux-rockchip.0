This is a bit of a mixed selection of patches to all areas of the
Rockchip dw-mipi-dsi driver, which I've been using for a while.

The first few patches fix the driver's use of the atomic API by removing
hardware manipulation from the mode_set hook:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: use mode from display state
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: pass new mode into MIPI mode set
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: don't configure hardware in mode_set for
    MIPI
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: rename commit hook to enable

The following several patches fix various aspects of DSI host transfers
in order to improve support for displays that need to be set up via DSI
commands:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: fix command header writes
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: fix generic packet status check
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: avoid out-of-bounds read on tx_buf
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: include bad value in error message
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: respect message flags
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: only request HS clock when required
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: don't assume buffer is aligned
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: prepare panel after phy init
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: allow commands in panel_disable

Then a bunch of patches to improve the PHY PLL and other clock setup:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: fix escape clock rate
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: ensure PHY is reset
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: configure bias and bandgap before enable
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: don't enable PHY PLL until it's configured
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: properly configure PHY timing
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: improve PLL configuration

A couple of patches make the VOP and MIPI host consistent when panels do
not set explicit hsync/vsync polarities:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: use positive check for N{H,V}SYNC
  drm/rockchip: vop: test for P{H,V}SYNC

The following patch fixes fbcon by making sure that the output
resolution is known before it loads:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: defer probe if panel is not loaded

Then a patch that should be self-explanatory:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: support non-burst modes

And the final two patches were useful in development but aren't really
needed once everything's working:

  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: add reset control
  drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: support read commands
