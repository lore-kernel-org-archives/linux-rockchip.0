Thierry, I didn't hear from you after the long discussion we had on IRC
a few weeks ago.
The conclusion of this discussion was that using
pwm_get_default_period() was not acceptable (even after renaming it
differently, like pwm_get_reference_period()), because it was
disturbing to get the default/reference period each time we wanted to
configure the PWM differently.
Another suggestion was to automatically reconfigure the PWM duty_ns
value based on the initial PWM state (retrieved through hardware
readout) and the default period value (specified in the PWM lookup table
or the DT). But this implied supporting hardware readout in all PWM
drivers, which prevents a smooth migration to this new approach.

I also proposed to provide helpers to hide the duty cycle to active
time calculation in the PWM core, so that PWM users just have to choose
their scale (percent, or any other custom scale) and set their duty
cycle based on this scale instead of specifying an active/on time in
nanosecond. You didn't seem to like this idea, but I gave it a try
(see here [1]), and think it might be worth looking at it.

The commit you should look at are [2], [3] and [4], and the idea is to
clarify the notion of duty-cycle, which, according to wikipedia [5]
(and a lot of other references) is supposed to be expressed in a
relative unit (percent, or any other scale as said earlier).
After renaming the pwm_set/get_duty_cycle() helpers into
pwm_set/get_active_time() we can define a new pwm_set_duty_cycle()
helper to let the PWM user configure its PWM device relatively to a
chosen scale, without asking him to choose the PWM period (the
conversion is done based on the default/reference period).
The pwm_get_duty_cycle() is doing the reverse conversion: it returns the
duty-cycle expressed relatively to the scale (here the current PWM
period is used to handle the case where the PWM user hasn't configure
the PWM yet, but want to retrieve the current duty-cycle extracted from
hardware readout).

Please let me know what you think of this approach, and if you're happy
with it I'll rework my series accordingly.

Best Regards,

Boris
