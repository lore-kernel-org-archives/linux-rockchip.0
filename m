I performed limited manually testing.

minnie ships with the Chrome OS 3.14 downstream, which doesn't include
this delay, to my knowledge there are no open display related bugs for
minnie. One could argue that a the configuration without the delay was
widely field tested

To my knowledge it doesn't really break anything, however there is a
short user perceptible delay between switching on the LCD and
switching on the backlight. It's not the end of the world, but if it's
not actually needed better avoid it.

I guess this is an edge case, were you could go either way. I'm fine
with respinning and cc-ing stable.
