I'm not worried about this one, as it is already special by not being compatible
with deferred probe. I.e. the caller already has to promise that the
corresponding probe() call will never return -EPROBE_DEFER.

This is a much more error prone requirement than just "don't call this from
async" already.

Yes, and as mentioned above, EPROBE_DEFER has always been a valid path for
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS, which is why I brought it up as a a workaround in the
first place.

(The reason why I still say "workaround" is because nothing actually needs to be
deferred.)

Anyways, as I mentioned...

...plus there are not a lot of PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS left anyways.

Do you want to send a patch?
