Hi Wolfram,

The default frequency rate of function clock is 50M Hz, it can match F/=
S=20
mode,
but HS mode not. If use default rate 50M to get 1.7M scl-frequency rate=
=20
, we could not
get accurately 1.7M frequecy rate. The input-clk-rate is more higher, w=
e=20
get more
accurately scl-frequency rate,  as 200M is a suitable input-clk-rate.

If 200M was used for F/S mode, it would increase power consumption, so=20
add a option that
could be configured from DT.
