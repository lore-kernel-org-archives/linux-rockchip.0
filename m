Here are the first three results from a Google query:

	https://www.yourdictionary.com/inversed
	https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inversed
	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inversed

I don't know. It's pretty common to use different words for the same
thing. They're called synonyms.

There's currently no problem, obviously. But if for some reason the
include files end up being included in a different order (i.e. the
dt-bindings header is included before linux/pwm.h) then the macro will
be evaluated and result in something like:

	enum pwm_polarity {
		PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL,
		1,
	};

and that's not valid C, so will cause a build error.

Again, seems to me like unnecessary churn. Feel free to propose
something, but I recall being in the same position at the time and this
was the best I could come up with.

Yes, the DTB is the ABI. dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h is used to generate DTBs,
which basically makes it ABI as well. Yes, the symbol name may not be
part of the ABI, but changing the symbol becomes very inconvenient
because everyone that depends on it would have to change. Why bother?

My point is that enum pwm_polarity is an API in the kernel and hence its
easy to change or extend. But since that is not the same for the DTB, we
need to be careful what from the internal kernel API leaks into the DTB.
That's why they are different symbols, so that it is clear that what's
in dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h is the ABI.
