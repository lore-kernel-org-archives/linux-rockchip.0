Completely agree here - we need a dt solution that allows us to
specify ordering.

I support a variety of IMX6 boards where for PCB routing reasons the
bootable MMC device is not always the first sdhc (sometimes the first
one is an SDIO radio for example). It seems ridiculous that I can't
handle this with:

        aliases {
                mmc0 =3D &usdhc3; /* MMC boot device */
                mmc1 =3D &usdhc2; /* SDIO radio */
        };

I see the imx6q-dhcom-som added in
52c7a088badd665a09ca9307ffa91e88d5686a7d re-defines the default
imx6qdl.dtsi mmc0-mmc3 aiases but I don't see any handling of this in
code anywhere - am I missing something?

Marek, why did you change the alias ordering for imx6q-dhcom-som.dtsi?
(maybe your carrying around a patch to make this useful?)

+       aliases {
+               mmc0 =3D &usdhc2;
+               mmc1 =3D &usdhc3;
+               mmc2 =3D &usdhc4;
+               mmc3 =3D &usdhc1;
+       };
