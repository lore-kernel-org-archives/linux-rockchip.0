Also, I actually realized that I may want to NAK my own patch and
possibly want to suggest doing the opposite: removing the set of
"PPLL" from the dtsi and moving it into the board .dts files for any
boards that need it.

Specifically on out rk3399 boards we use PWM regulators for all the
major rails in the system.  The firmware inits the PWMs to give the
system a good voltage and then boots the kernel.  The kernel reads the
PWMs to find out what the boot voltage was.

That whole scheme only works if the PWM's clock doesn't get mucked
with at bootup.  ...and the PWM's clock is derived from "pclk_pmu_src"
which comes from PPLL.

So it's actually very important that we _don't_ mess with whatever the
firmware set here and that the firmware set something sane.

Yes, if this is a good idea we should update our firmware to do it.
