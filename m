Yes, though since I'm not personally working on the other patch series
upstream I can't say for how long the "temporary" is..  I mostly
posted the 2nd patch because it was clearly correct to add some
pinmuxing states and could land any time, so I thought I'd be helpful.

You're right that in the Chrome OS tree I turned right around and
effectively removed the "ddc-i2c-bus", but having it land first adds a
much better logical progression (make it the same as everyone else and
_then_ change it).  It also provides a revert path if something goes
wrong.  :)

I will say that I know very very little about DRM.  Mostly I just
visit it when there's some bug I'm running into that I can't find a
better suited owner for.  ;)

I'm not sure I followed your whole paragraph.  Could you give a
fragment of DTS for how you'd imagine this ought to work?  Also: the
patch I submitted does match the current bindings if I understand it
right.  ...as is typical with device tree, if we want to change the
bindings we've got to have a really good reason because we'd either
need to figure out how to deal with existing DTBs in the field that
need to run with newer kernels (if those exist).
