No, because you haven't taken the time to think and consider my
reply, which gives you insight into how your "problem" is no
different from the situation that everyone else has, where it
isn't a problem.

I think the "problem" here is that you've got used to coreboot
doing something that very few other boot loaders do, namely it
automatically extracting a rootfs UUID for you.  The rest of the
world doesn't have that luxury.

So, instead, you want to stuff more code into the kernel to work
around what you think is a problem - a problem which seems to be
unique to yourself.

The UUID and label solutions were created by x86 people to work
around exactly this dynamic device problem, and as my previous
replies have shown, it is superior to fixing the device assignment
as you're trying to do.

However, I don't expect that you'll like this answer, and you'll
probably just re-post your same question after each and every
paragraph rather than considering whether the already existing
solutions could solve your "problem".  So I'm just wasting my time.

This is my last reply.
