The name "fixed mode" comes from the old code, though I guess in the
old code it used to refer to a mode that came from either the
display_timing or the display_mode.

How about if I call it "panel_simple_get_from_fixed_display_mode"?
...or if you have another suggestion feel free to chime in.

NOTE: Since this feedback is minor and this patch has been outstanding
for a while (and is blocking other work), I am assuming that the best
path forward is for Heiko to land this patch with Thierry's Ack and
I'll send a follow-up.  Please yell if you disagree.  I'll respond to
each of your emails separately and then wait for your response before
sending the follow-up series.
