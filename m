This adds a mali-supply similar to the Midgard binding, the
compatibles for 3 Rockchip socs and the nodes for these.

The rk3036 and rk3188 gpus were tested, on the boards that
get their gpus enabled, using the current Lima resurrection
project and were able to probe the gpus sucessfully and draw
a nice red-triangle in an off-screen application.

The only special thing Rockchip Malis do, is that all MMUs have
a shared interrupt and all PPs also have a shared interrupt, but
that works out well with the current binding.


changes in v2:
- adapt to Rob's comment for the compatibles, not sure how I could miss
  the long compatible list at the top in the first place :-)
- add Rob's Ack for patch 2 and adapt styling to match the other properties
- add power-domains as optional property


The power-domains are missing from the actual devicetree patches for now,
as the rk3036 does not have any and I just submitted power-domain support
for rk3188 in a separate series. So while the rk3188 needs a power-domain
it's driver is still in-flight :-)
