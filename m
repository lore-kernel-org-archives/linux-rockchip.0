I should have spoken up when Rob made the suggestion, because I more or
less agree with Benjamin here. I don't really see why this needs to have
a specialized compatible string, as the property is still fairly
generic, and the entire device handling is via a generic protocol. The
fact that we manage its power via a regulator is not very
device-specific.

Thanks.

As Benjamin noticed on patch 2, I added a delay property; I realized I
had been hacking that delay in to the regulator framework as a "ramp
delay" property, when in fact it was actually a property of *this*
device -- the 100 ms wait is a suggested wait for the HID firmware to
boot, not for the regulator to stabilize.

So, what do you two think about the following two properties?

 - vdd-supply, as in the quoted patch
 - init-delay-ms: time required by the device after power-on before it
   is ready for communication

And I'd drop the extra compatible property.

Brian
