Nice work! It all looks good to me, let's see what Heiko says.

Please keep Julia Cartwright on the CC for this patch series, she is
doing some coccinelle-based rewrites to use raw spinlocks as we
speak, and she knows this stuff.

She has not targeted the Rockchip driver yet, I guess because of
its complexity.
