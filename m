If you're using Exynos as an example, please keep in mind that the
libdrm license is MIT/X11, not GPL as the kernel. For our Linux distro
we had to disable some Exynos parts because they snuck some GPL code in
there and redistributing libdrm under GPL would cause a big headache
(review of all packages directly or indirectly linking against it).

Thanks,
Andreas
