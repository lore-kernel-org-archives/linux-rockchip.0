I think the subject line and this first paragraph are misleading since
the simple power sequence provider already supports power-on sequencing.

This patch does not add or enable support but extends the current support
to also enable a regulator as a part of the SDIO chip power on sequencing.

This part confuses me, so does your chip have an actual regulator that
needs to be enabled or is just a fake regulator whose gpio property is
used not to enable the regulator but to toggle the WL_REG_ON pin of
the WiFi chip?

Can you please elaborate on this? AFAIU this limitation is the reason
why you went with the regulator approach so I think it deserve a more
deep explanation.
