Based on Igor Paunovic's "[PATCH v2] accel/rocket: request the core
clocks by name", as v6 was:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20260729130743.128876-1-royalnet026@gmail.com/

Tested on a Radxa ROCK 4D, on next-20260730.

The thing this series has been describing as unsolved since v3 is solved,
and it was one register write. That changes the cover letter more than it
changes the patches, so the correction comes first.

The claim I have to withdraw
============================

Every version of this series from v1 to v6 has said that the RK3576's
completion interrupt is armed exactly as on RK3588 and never reaches the
GIC, and v6 shipped an hrtimer that samples INTERRUPT_RAW_STATUS instead
of waiting for it. That is not true. The interrupt works.

It never fired because the block believed it had 28672 tasks left to
run, so the job was never complete. PC_TASK_CON packs the task number
with three controls above it, and the field widths are not the same on
both SoCs:

  RK3588   BIT[11:0] task_number, BIT[12] pp_en, BIT[13] count_clear
  RK3576   BIT[15:0] task_number, BIT[16] pp_en, BIT[17] count_clear,
           BIT[18] last_layer_clear

rocket_registers.h is generated from the RK3588 description, so writing
it unchanged on an RK3576 asks for task_number 0x7001, that is 28673
tasks, and puts TASK_COUNT_CLEAR on a bit that does nothing. The counter
was then only ever cleared by a reset, which is precisely the "one task
per reset" shape v6 reported, and it is why every completion path I
added looked necessary.

It was found by taking an ordered trace of every register write during
one submit and diffing it against the same trace from the vendor driver
on the same board. Exactly one value differed.

Robin and Diederik, my apologies for the thread that premise cost you.
Robin's shortlist for an interrupt that never arrives was an extra clock
or power domain in the path, a masking control that had been overlooked,
a wrong description, or terminally broken hardware. It was none of those,
because the interrupt was not the thing that was wrong.

Chaoyi Chen of Rockchip confirmed the layout on the list, including the
fourth control at BIT(18) that the trace could not have named:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/4f300b78-d96d-4d98-8819-dc292b0c9b97@rock-chips.com/

I sent a correction to the list when this landed rather than leaving it
until now:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260807211629.1573228-1-gahing@gahingwoo.com/

So v7 drops the poll entirely. There is no hrtimer, no poll work, no
second completion path and no arbitration between two of them. A job is
retired by its interrupt, the way it is on RK3588.

Changes in v7
=============

  * accel/rocket: PC_TASK_CON is written with the RK3576 field layout.
    The defines are in rocket_job.c rather than in rocket_registers.h,
    which is generated and says not to edit it by hand.

  * accel/rocket: the completion poll and everything supporting it is
    gone: poll_completion, the hrtimer, the work, poll_seq and its
    mirror, poll_dying, the teardown ordering in rocket_job_fini() and
    the arbitration in rocket_job_handle_irq(). 7/9 in v6 was 142 added
    lines in rocket_job.c and 8/10 here is 90, most of which is the
    comment explaining the register.

  * accel/rocket: the job_lock fix is its own patch now, 1/10, with a
    Fixes tag. It is an RK3588 bug and it was buried in the middle of a
    preparation patch in v6, where nobody could backport it.

  * accel/rocket: the power domain list is attached before
    iommu_group_get() rather than after rocket_job_init(). In v6 a
    failure there returned without unwinding either of them. Igor caught
    it. Moving the call is better than adding an unwind path, since
    everything before that point is devres managed and a plain return is
    then correct. It also keeps commit f509a081f6a2
    ("accel/rocket: fix unwinding in error path in rocket_core_init")
    from having a second copy of itself to keep in step.

  * accel/rocket: struct rocket_core's clks[] no longer grows in 7/10.
    Igor pointed out that 7/10 claimed nothing changes for RK3588 while
    growing the array there, with the two extra names only arriving in
    8/10. The array now grows in the patch that adds the names.

  * The series is 10 patches rather than 9 because of the split above.
    Nothing else moved.

What this means for the split in 7/10 and 8/10
==============================================

Diederik asked for the enablement to be split and Igor seconded it, and
v6 did that. The split survives v7 unchanged: 7/10 is the soc_data
plumbing with RK3588 keeping four clocks and two resets, and 8/10 is the
RK3576 enablement. What changed is that 8/10 is now much smaller.

Where it stands
===============

With every debug knob off, on a ROCK 4D:

  * the NPU probes with the two domain list and no attach failure;
  * a convolution submitted three times with three different inputs is
    byte exact against the CPU reference each time, with no reset in
    between and with nothing retiring the job but the interrupt;
  * the NPU's line in /proc/interrupts goes from zero to three across
    those three submits, one each and no more;
  * unbind and rebind is clean with no warning;
  * every patch builds on its own;
  * dt_binding_check is clean on all three bindings the series touches.

The measurement in v6 that could not tell a recomputation from an
untouched output buffer has been replaced by one that can: the inputs
differ between submits, so a stale buffer cannot pass.

That was run on this branch with nothing else applied. The out of tree
work this hardware has needed for the userspace investigation, including
an rk_iommu flush_iotlb_all that is neither upstream nor in this series,
is not present, and the userspace results below are the same without it.

The userspace side is a separate matter and is not part of this series.
It runs regular convolutions, depthwise convolutions and the first
convolution of MobileNet V1 byte exact per output channel against the
CPU reference, and two chained operators come out at the accuracy the
hardware's own arithmetic allows. A whole MobileNet does not run yet.
Nothing that is still wrong there is in the kernel.

Igor, thank you again for the RK3588 review. Both of the things you
found in v6 are addressed above and the completion path has changed
enough that it needs another look rather than a carried tag. Your offer
to run this on all three RK3588 cores would be very welcome, since the
only behaviour change to RK3588 in the series is the job_lock ordering
in 1/10 and I cannot test it here.
