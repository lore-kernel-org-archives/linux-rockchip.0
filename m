Hi again Kishon,

I didn't get a response from you, but Shawn is continuing to send
several versions of a patchset implementing one of these suggestions.
I'd like to ping back here, in the hopes of getting an answer.

Judging by Shawn's subsequent patches, I guess he saw no problem with
this. I'm still not so sure.

Can I get an answer here? Is it possible that we extend the PHY API with
either a new 'phy_mode', or with some other PCIe-specific extension? As
I said above, it doesn't actually seem like a natural description of the
hardware to say that there are 4 PHYs here, instead of just 1. And then
it puts more burden on the provider/consumer drivers to do a lot of
weird accounting, just so that this single piece of hardware can fit the
current limited set of APIs.

This is not the first time that some concept isn't so easy to fit into
the existing framework. I think it would be prudent to consider ways to
better extend the API to support modes specific to device classes.
You've already done that for some USB pieces, and I think it would make
sense to extend this to PCIe. For instance, we could have the PHY export
things like "number of PCIe lanes", and support callbacks for "disable
unused lanes".

I guess Shawn was able to work out some of this. But all the extra
state-tracking and reference counting appears to be hard to get right...
