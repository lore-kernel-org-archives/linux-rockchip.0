It is not that clear. The widget seems to be an integral part of the
device, as it is the same basic IP that is used for SDIO and USB.

It looks like the good old pre-PCI-2.2 days, where you had to have a
separate cable between your network card and the base-board for the
wake-up interrupt to be delivered. Starting with PCI-2.2, the bus can
carry the signal just fine. With PCIe, it should just be an interrupt
TLP sent to the RC, but that's obviously not within the capabilities of
the HW.

Anyway, it'd be good if the Marvell people could chime in and let us
know how they'd prefer to handle this.

Thanks,
