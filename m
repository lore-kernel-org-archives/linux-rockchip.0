That's an example, not a definition. And the definition I quoted
literally says "device specific interrupt name". The PCIe specification
calls it "WAKE#" all over the place, so I figured that's a good name to
use.

"wakeup" is also fine I suppose, as long as we document that it must be
PCIe WAKE# signal, as per the PCIe specfication.
