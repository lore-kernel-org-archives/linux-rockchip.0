I'm assuming from the wiring (and from how I recall my 3288/3328 boxes 
behaving) that the dedicated function implements its own debouncing - 
seems the switch in this particular socket is noisy enough that the GPIO 
interrupt is firing well over 100 times per physical event. Not a big 
deal really, I just need to scratch the itch of making things work 
'properly' ;)

Yeah, it would end up being one of those things that's really handy for 
about 5 minutes every couple of years, and a massive pain to maintain 
the rest of the time. Plus I realise that I'd want to compare the 
behaviour of stock kernels anyway, and having to patch and rebuild those 
rather defeats the point.

Thanks,
Robin.
