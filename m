Hello,

I have heard that this is still an issue in RK3288 support in mainline
so have given a look and wonder if you have considered having the
consumers of a shared clock (which could be a child clock) use
PRE_RATE_CHANGE notifications to adapt to changes in a parent's rate,
or to abort them if that's not possible.

Alternatively, a consumer can set min and max constraints if it
doesn't want for others to mess with its provider, and let the other
consumer deal with failed rate changes (probably by choosing another
provider).

Have I missed any problems with that?

Thanks,

Tomeu
