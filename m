So this FAIL is for /dev/v4l-subdev0 (rkisp1-isp-subdev).

What is weird that this subdev does not appear to have controls at all.

What is the output of 'v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev0 -l'? And if it lists
controls, then why?

If you run 'v4l2-compliance -u /dev/v4l-subdev0', do you get a fail as
well?

BTW, note that struct rkisp1_isp_subdev has a ctrl_handler field that
isn't used at all.

Regards,
