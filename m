As I'm a total noob when it comes to soldering (especially on such a ti=
ny=20

Reading that bug report again, brought back memories, that exactly this=

it looks like you and me are the only people still caring for pinky and=
=20
everybody else most likely put theirs into the trash already, so nothin=
g=20
