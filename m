Indeed, which is why I already mentioned in the patch description
that I do plan to update the constraints of all regulators to match
the summary of the constraints of their consumers.  Though, I plan
to do that later, as a separate directory-wide cleanup, for which
I must find and allocate a substantial amount of time, to make sure
there will be no mistakes.

Well, maybe the RK3399S is the same in that regard as the RK3399-T,
but maybe it actually isn't -- unfortunately, we don't have some
official RK3399S datasheet that would provide us with the required
information.  As another, somewhat unrelated example, we don't have
some official documentation to tell us is the RK3399S supposed not
to have working PCI Express interface, which officially isn't present
in the RK3399-T variant.

However, I fully agree that forcing any kind of an overclock is not
what we want to do.  Thus, I'll do my best, as I already noted in this
thread, to extract the dtb from the "reference" Android build that
Rockchip itself provided for the RK3399S-based PinePhone Pro.  That's
closest to the official documentation for the RK3399S variant that we
can get our hands on.
