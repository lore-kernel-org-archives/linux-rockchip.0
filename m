Bind / unbind stress testing of the USB controller on rk3399 found
that we'd often end up with lots of failures that looked like this:

  phy phy-ff800000.phy.9: phy poweron failed --> -110
  dwc3 fe900000.dwc3: failed to initialize core
  dwc3: probe of fe900000.dwc3 failed with error -110

Those errors were sometimes seen at bootup too, in which case USB
peripherals wouldn't work until unplugged and re-plugged in.

I spent some time trying to figure out why the PHY was failing to
power on but I wasn't able to.  Possibly this has to do with the fact
that the PHY docs say that the USB controller "needs to be held in
reset to hold pipe power state in P2 before initializing the Type C
PHY" but that doesn't appear to be easy to do with the dwc3 driver
today.  Messing around with the ordering of the reset vs. the PHY
initialization in the dwc3 driver didn't seem to fix things.

I did, however, find that if I simply retry the power on it seems to
have a good chance of working.  So let's add some retries.  I ran a
pretty tight bind/unbind loop overnight.  When I did so, I found that
I need to retry between 1% and 2% of the time.  Overnight I found only
a small handful of times where I needed 2 retries.  I never found a
case where I needed 3 retries.

I'm completely aware of the fact that this is quite an ugly hack and I
wish I didn't have to resort to it, but I have no other real idea how
to make this hardware reliable.  If Rockchip in the future can come up
with a solution we can always revert this hack.  Until then, let's at
least have something that works.

This patch is tested atop Enric's latest dwc3 patch series ending at:
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10095527/
...but it could be applied independently of that series without any
bad effects.
