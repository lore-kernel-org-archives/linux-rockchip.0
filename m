yes, it looks like there's no way to free resources allocated in 
of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources, expect for the err path: 
kfree(window->res).

i think it's a common issue, which may not get fix in rockchip pci driver.

maybe we should modify of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources, pass the struct 
device to it, and change all kzalloc to devm_kzalloc(also remove the kfree)
