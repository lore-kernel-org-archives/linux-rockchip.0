Nice :-)

As I only have a standard 1080p display it's hard to check those edge cases,
but the struggle for display frequencies follows us for quite some time
already.

The current default is to source the display clock from the hdmi-phy
which contains its own pll, so I guess first order of business should
probably be to determine which rate gets requested for your display
and which rate gets set - as I'm guessing that we're missing rates.

DRM_WARNS would be interesting I guess, can you post them?
As for your hdmi-interrupts, from the dw-hdmi or the hdmi-phy?
