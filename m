Hi Marc,

Thanks for the quick response.

Indeed, sorry for that confusion, and thanks for the explanations.

It's beginning to seem more like a HW quirk which yields nonstandard
behavior. AIUI, this SoC normally runs the counter off its 24 MHz clock,
but for low power modes, this "always-on" domain switches over to a 32
KHz alternative clock. Unfortunately, the counter doesn't actually tick
when run this way. I'm trying to confirm with the chip designers
(Rockchip, RK3399) about the nature of the quirk, but I think we'll need
a separate DT flag for this behavior.
