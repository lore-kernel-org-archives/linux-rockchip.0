As I tried to indicate in earlier emails, I don't actually care how
grub works in this case.  It was originally meant to illustrate the
other people's workflows and mine are not the same.  If they have a
solution that works for them, that's great.

I want my MMC and MMCBLK device numbers to be sane and consistent to
help me parse through dmesg and sysfs.  If it happens to also make it
easy / possible to specify a root filesystem using "mmcblkN" that's
great and I'll probably take advantage of that.

I'm very sorry if those using SATA and ATA disks don't have a way to
get sane and consistent device number ordering.  I really am.  ...but
just because they don't have a well defined ordering doesn't mean
those of us using MMC should have to suffer.  ...and I don't think
giving a sane ordering to MMC devices hurts anyone, does it?
