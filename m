Let me rephrase my question.

Can the vdd_gpu/pd_gpu ever remain in a powered on state while the
system is suspended?

If yes, when is that the case?

*Exactly*, how do you guarantee that a pm_runtime_put() for the gpu
device triggers a runtime suspend - before a system suspend sequence
starts?

For example, userspace may via sysfs prevent runtime suspend for any
device with runtime PM enabled.

Thanks for these details, very useful!
