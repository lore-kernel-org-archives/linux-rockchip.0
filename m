As I mentioned, I have one HW which can be used in two different configurations
and targeted to perform two different function (RT vs non-RT).
So, is it expected to burn/replace DT in the above case?

Do you replace DT (or u-boot) each time you load new kernel?

TWD? I did not mention TWD anywhere here.

Oh :) There are big difference between clocksource and clockevent devices :(
I assume you are talking about clockevent devices then yes, for these kind
of timers the broadcast timer is used as backup timer in CPUIdle states.
(and TWD is always selected now in favor of ARM GT clockevent device on my HW)

But, I need and use ARM GT as clocksource/sched_clock - for these type of timers
no backup timers can be registered.
Last try to add such functionality was rejected [1]

ok. That fair. I'd need to drop first paragraph. But problem exist anyway

./arch/arm/mach-vexpress/Kconfig:	select ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER
vs
./arch/arm/mach-zynq/Kconfig:	select ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER if !CPU_FREQ
as example

I can do that. How about:
---
ARM: clocksource: Make ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER a selectable 

There is no way now to disable ARM GT without modifying Kconfig file,
once ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER is selected statically in Kconfig file.

Hence, make ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER a selectable feature for builds that want
to disable that functionality by defining both HAVE_ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER and
ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER as recommended by 'Adding common features and make
the usage configurable' section in kconfig-language.txt. All places in
ARM folder where ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER was used now replaced on
HAVE_ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER.
