Personally, I don't have any real opinion on this but the argument soun=
ds=20
plausible to me (aka they are named with numbers in every manual, schem=
atics)=20
so it might be helpful to have that around - similar to i2c that is in =
the=20
dtsi already.

I think I remember Doug having a similar discussion around mmc-aliases =
some=20
time ago - that met opposition as well [0] - although I guess the numbe=
ring=20
was a bit more arbitary there.

I guess we'll just see what Rob says.
