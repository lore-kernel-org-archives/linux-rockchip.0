I've already done the conversion so that vendor, product, supported_formats and
max_bpc values previously passed as arguments are now provided through
drm_connector_hdmi_funcs, along with the additional supported_hdmi_ver and
supported_tmds_char_rate fields.

In most cases it wasn't necessary to pass this data dynamically (with the
exception of the bridge connector and some kunit tests), so it was just a matter
of extending the immutable hdmi_funcs structs.

I'll send v9 a bit later today so we can discuss directly on the code changes.

FWIW, in the VC4 case, I followed Maxime's suggestion and introduced three 
hdmi_funcs instances (+ a macro to avoid duplication) and assigned them to the
corresponding vc4_hdmi_variant entries:

#define VC4_HDMI_CONNECTOR_FUNCS_COMMON						\
	.vendor			 = "Broadcom",					\
	.product		 = "Videocore",					\
	.supported_formats	 = BIT(DRM_OUTPUT_COLOR_FORMAT_RGB444) |	\
				   BIT(DRM_OUTPUT_COLOR_FORMAT_YCBCR422) |	\
				   BIT(DRM_OUTPUT_COLOR_FORMAT_YCBCR444),	\
	.tmds_char_rate_valid	 = vc4_hdmi_connector_clock_valid,		\
	.avi = {								\
		.clear_infoframe = vc4_hdmi_clear_avi_infoframe,		\
		.write_infoframe = vc4_hdmi_write_avi_infoframe,		\
	},									\
	.hdmi = {								\
		.clear_infoframe = vc4_hdmi_clear_hdmi_infoframe,		\
		.write_infoframe = vc4_hdmi_write_hdmi_infoframe,		\
	},									\
	...

static const struct drm_connector_hdmi_funcs vc4_hdmi_connector_funcs_hdmi14 = {
	VC4_HDMI_CONNECTOR_FUNCS_COMMON,
	.max_bpc		= 12,
	.supported_hdmi_ver	= HDMI_VERSION_1_4,
};

static const struct drm_connector_hdmi_funcs vc4_hdmi_connector_funcs_hdmi20 = {
	VC4_HDMI_CONNECTOR_FUNCS_COMMON,
	.max_bpc		= 12,
	.supported_hdmi_ver	= HDMI_VERSION_2_0,
	.scrambler_enable	= vc4_hdmi_scrambler_enable,
	.scrambler_disable	= vc4_hdmi_scrambler_disable,
};


static const struct vc4_hdmi_variant bcm2712_hdmi0_variant = {
	...
	.hp_detect		= vc5_hdmi_hp_detect,
	.hdmi_funcs		= &vc4_hdmi_connector_funcs_hdmi20,
};

vc4_hdmi_connector_init()
{
	...
	ret = drmm_connector_hdmi_init(dev, connector,
				       &vc4_hdmi_connector_funcs,
				       vc4_hdmi->variant->hdmi_funcs,
				       DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_HDMIA,
				       vc4_hdmi->ddc);
	...
}
