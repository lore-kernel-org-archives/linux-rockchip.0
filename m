Thanks! I take it that to mean you're agreeing with Doug's suggestion
here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/6/13/1067

"Since [the $subject series patches] aren't in 4.7-rc1 presumably they
would also make sense to take through the MMC tree if others agree."

Ulf,

I see I didn't CC you or linux-mmc on this patch series. Please let me
know if I should resend, or if you can pick these up off of LKML -- Doug
gave nice patchwork links in his linked series. NB: patch 2 has a
version 2, while the others were left unmodified.

Regards,
Brian
