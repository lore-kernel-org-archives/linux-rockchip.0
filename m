Hi,

I didn't look as deeply as Heiko, but a few comments...

Also don't forget to remove the controversial pmu bits for now (as
discussed earlier) so this can land while all those kinks are being
worked out.

I agree with Heiko.  This sounds very sane to me, too, and matches
previous discussions.

=46rom what I recall during the submission of the previous PHY Kishon
preferred the subnodes.  I think I made a fool of myself in the last
discussion about this because I reported bugs in my downstream kernel
that didn't exist upstream, but if you want to read it you can see
here:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5474871/

I believe patch v6 used IDs like Heiko is suggesting and it turned to
subnodes in v7 based on Kishon's request.  Since PHY code and bindings
are Kishon's call, I have a feeling his opinion will trump here.

Just because it took me an extra reading to understand, he means turn
"echi" to "ehci".

I'm really surprised that there's not some generic fallback for
"dwc3-of-simple.c".  I would have expected:
  "rockchip,rk3399-dwc3", "synopsis,dwc3";

=2E..but that doesn't appear to be in the bindings.  Weird.

I think it can work with the rk3288-i2c as a fallback, at least for
low speed stuff, right?  Should this be:

compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3399-i2c", "rockchip,rk3288-i2c"

Looks like that was done for rk3368.
