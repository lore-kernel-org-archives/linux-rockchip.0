And I'm entirely on your side here.

You might have missed it, but that's OK for me, too. And note that after
applying the whole series the enum is gone and so the problem. (First
hunk of include/linux/pwm.h in patch 5.)

grep doesn't know about synonyms, so if I grep for stuff about inverted
PWMs in the kernel I completely miss one half as it's called inversed
there. (Yeah sure, I can also grep for "inversed|inverted", but therefor
I have to know first that both are used interchangable here.)

That's a bit like a schematic that has "RESET#" in one place and
"nRESET" in an other. If you stumble about that you wonder if they are
two different names for the same signal or if they are actually two
different ones.

Have you ever read a specification that described some property, gave it
a name and then later used a synonym to describe it? In my eyes that's a
bad idea.

Everything you need to remember (or learn) about a subsystem makes it
harder work with it.

If there is a technical need to have different names that's one thing.
But using synonyms to differentiate them is not optimal. Then please
let's have names where looking at the identifier makes it obvious which
is for the device trees and which for the API enum.

I don't understand why you proved something here. I didn't doubt this.

Oh, that's worse than I expected. There are two .c files that include
dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h:

	drivers/rtc/rtc-omap.c
	drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c

So the definition isn't even used in the gpio core to parse dt-stuff.
(And both files don't use any definition of that file :-|)

If a consumer or provider includes the dt-bindings file there is
something fishy. (Still catching this with a compiler message better
than "expected identifier before ‘(’ token" would be good.)

I don't want to follow your argument that dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h is ABI
as well. device tree binaries follow an ABI (similar to machine code),
but the compiler and the source code (including headers) are not.

The other way round however is fine, isn't it? So use the dt definition
in the kernel should be ok.
