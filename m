I'm missing the use-case when using the devfreq_suspend_device()
before entering the suspend mode. We should consider the case when
devfreq device
calls the devfreq_suspend_device() directly. Because devfreq_suspend_device=
()
is exported function, each devfreq device call this function on the fly
without entering the suspend mode.

I correct my opinion. Your approach is necessary. I'm sorry to confuse you.
So, I make the following patch. This patch set the suspend frequency
in devfreq_suspend_device() after stoping the governor.
It consider the all governors of devfreq.

What do you think?
If you are ok, I'll send this patch with your author.

 int devfreq_suspend_device(struct devfreq *devfreq)
 {
+      int ret =3D 0;
+
        if (!devfreq)
        return -EINVAL;

        if (!devfreq->governor)
             return 0;

-      return devfreq->governor->event_handler(devfreq,
+     ret =3D devfreq->governor->event_handler(devfreq,
                    DEVFREQ_GOV_SUSPEND, NULL);
+      if (ret < 0) {
+           dev_err(devfreq->dev.parent, "failed to suspend governor\n");
+           return ret;
+      }
+
+      if (devfreq->suspend_freq) {
+           ret =3D devfreq->profile->target(devfreq->dev.parent,
+                                      &devfreq->suspend_freq, 0);
+           if (ret < 0) {
+                  dev_err(devfreq->dev.parent,
+                             "failed to set suspend-freq\n");
+                  return ret;
+           }
+           dev_dbg(devfreq->dev.parent, "Setting suspend-freq: %lu\n",
+                          devfreq->suspend_freq);
+      }
+
+      return 0;
 }
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(devfreq_suspend_device);
