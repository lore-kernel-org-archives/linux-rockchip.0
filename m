I assume you're talking about lspci code here, where the bit is called
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CLOCK.  The only use of PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CLOCK in lspci
is to decode it in cap_express_link().  I don't know what you mean by
"tracing CCC", since lspci only decodes registers of one device at a
time; it never follows the hierarchy from an endpoint up to a root
port.

I'm not sure how this lspci information is relevant to this patch.

Here I think you're talking about pcie_aspm_configure_common_clock()
in Linux.  That looks at PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC on both ends of a link.
If PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC is set at both ends, we set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC
on both ends; otherwise we clear PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC on both ends.
This follows the Implementation Note in PCIe r3.1, sec 7.8.7.

Per that note, PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC in the root port tells us whether
the port "uses a clock that has a common source ... to the clock
signal provided on the slot" below the port.

This patch sets PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC based on your knowledge of the
platform topology, i.e., that the root port clock and the slot clock
have the same source.  I assume this is *always* the case for every
possible platform using Rockchip?

If so, just say that, and you can go on to say that this enables the
ASPM code to set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC if the downstream end also sets
PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC to indicate that it uses the clock provided on the
slot, e.g., something like this:

  All platforms using Rockchip use a common clock for the Root Port
  and the slot connected to it.  Indicate this by setting the Slot
  Clock Configuration (PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC) bit in the Root Port's Link
  Status.

  Per the Implementation Note in the spec (PCIe r3.1, sec 7.8.7), if
  the downstream component also sets PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC, software may
  set the Common Clock Configuration (PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC) bits on both
  ends of the Link.  This is done by pcie_aspm_configure_common_clock().

This patch doesn't change anything with PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC.  I'd
suggest that we should *not* set it here because we have no idea what
(if anything) is at the other end of the link.  Per the implementation
note, I think we should only set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC if both ends of
the link have PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC set.

Are you suggesting that we should set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC on both ends
of the link whenever possible, and that today we don't do that unless
ASPM is enabled?  That sounds plausible to me, but that would be a
generic PCIe enhancement, not anything Rockchip-specific, and of
course, this patch doesn't make that happen.
