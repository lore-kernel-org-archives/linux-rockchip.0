OK, I will list that devices.
At the moment, I don't find the EDP driver for rockchip. (I think the=20
EDP driver hasn't a upstream).

Anyway, I will test it on=20
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chrom=
eos-3.14,
Meanwhile work on next-kernel.

Interesting. Do you want to put the domain driver into /driver/soc/rock=
chip?
I guess the efuse driver ...is also do that.

Perhaps, it's a good select in the future.

How about this patch?

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5145241/

I will do that.

Maybe, do you have more suggestions?
