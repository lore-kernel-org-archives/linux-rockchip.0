If you base your work on top of (i.e. you rework) someone else's patch
you should retain this authorship and signed-off-by line. This of
course is not limited to the above patch but a general rule, afaik.

Have you discussed this limitation with Liu ? Does your work handle
both versions of the controller ? If so your commit message should say
something about that. Here are some good sources on the whats and whys
wrt writing good commit messages [1] [2]

If a patch has been reviewed/acked that's great. Add the tag, but
please do not drop patches until they are merged. In the latter case
you can mention that your series depends on branch X from repo Y.

No need to add me bth. Thierry on the other hand should be Cc'd on the
patches where he's the maintainer.

As the To/Cc list is already quite excessive - I'd suggest following
the approach used by veterans in kernel development.

I'm not a veteran kernel dev, but this is what I've noticed over the years:
 - Subsystem foo - mailing-list, maintainer(s), and optionally the top
1-2 developers
 - Other subsystems - mailing-list and optionally the maintainer(s).

Thus in the case of the panel driver you'll get - dri-devel, Thierry
and optionally(?) devicetree
For the DT binding for the panel driver - devicetree, Rob, dri-devel, Thierry.

...I think you get the idea :-)

Emil
