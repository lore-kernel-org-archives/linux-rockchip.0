Fixes: b1a76f75d76e ("ARM: dts: rockchip: add MiQi board from mqmaker")

Interestingly schematics for MiQi still point to GPIO7_A4 as led pin, but I 
haven't looked at my pre-production miqi for quite some time.

So anyway, applied for 4.12

The led pinctrl could've simply be changed to also use the correct pin instead 
of removing it, but as the pin is used as output only and not requested with 
open-drain/open-source characteristics, this should not matter much.
