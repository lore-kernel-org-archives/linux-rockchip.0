Of course :-D .
Collecting reviews can take time, so posting things early is helpful,
especially now that you actually can generate output.

That is the one requirement I have ... that things actually work and
the vop-driver alone didn't look that way some weeks back ;-)
[And as we found out was also missing the changed irq].

You can strip the audio parts from the hdmi-encoder and just submit
it with the display parts only.

That way we can possibly pick up the working things already, reducing
the number of patches you have to carry around ;-) .

I think making this actually work will fall on your shoulders.
I.e. the rk3066 is really old (from 2012 or possibly even earlier), so
people like Tomasz don't have access to this (and also in most cases
not the time or interest to work on those specific socs).

While I do have a rk3066 marsboard here, it is currently not functional
in my test setup, so I also can only look at the code you provide.


Happy hacking
Heiko
