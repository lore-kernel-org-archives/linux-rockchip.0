Why don't you use labels? This works whether your rootfs is on
/dev/vdXy, /dev/sdXy or /dev/mmcblkXpy. I can feel your pain as I've
been looking at the per device crap that is Android fstab files which
labels solve beautifully and worked without Android changes.

Sorry, I'm not keen to add something that is both MMC and DT specific.
If consistent numbering for devices is a goal in the kernel, then I'd
feel otherwise. But I'm pretty sure that is a non-goal.

Aliases were largely intended for backwards compatibility in cases
where the numbering was already consistent (IOW consoles).
