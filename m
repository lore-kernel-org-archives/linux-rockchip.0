Sounds resonable, the domain(e.g. "pd_vio"...) idle will be abnormal bu=
t=20
you have registered all devices.
Why?
AFAIK, you need turn on the noc/ip clocks if we are operating the=20
"pd_vio" domain to enter the idle status.
if the noc is same clock with ip side.  We need turn on the IP side=20
clocks. Otherwise we need turn on the noc clocks.

Okay, As the cover-letter lists.
We can add the EDP/VOP domain node to test in next-kernel.

Also, the chromium-3.14 has some devices to complete it.
