When connecting to certain DP monitors it was observed that only one
of the two orientations of the type C to DP cable would work.
Debugging showed that the problem was that we needed to set the type C
"flip" state earlier.  Once we did this, problems went away.

While trying to dig into this problem and some others, I found that
the proper documentation for the Type C PHY was available to me.  This
allowed me to cleanup the magic numbers in the funtion that I was
touching and also fix a few minor issues that (luckily) haven't caused
any problems yet.

For this series I've added Chris Zhong's Reviewed-by tags since he
gave a +1 to nearly identical patches on the Chrome OS gerrit and I
didn't think he'd mind me carrying his tag.  If folks would rather I
didn't do that, please yell.
