The patch

   ASoC: rockchip: rockchip_max98090: Set period size to 240

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.3

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rockchip: rockchip_max98090: Set period size to 240

From stress testing of arecord, we found that period size
greater than ~900 will bring pl330 to DYING state and
can not recover within 100 iterations.
The result is that arecord will stuck and get I/O error,
and issue can not be recovered until reboot.

This issue does not happen when period size is small.
Set constraint of period size to 240 to prevent such issue.
With the constraint, there will be no issue after 2000 iterations.

We can revert this patch once the root cause is found
in rockchip's pl330 implementation.
