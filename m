Hi Caesar,


thanks for keeping this alive :-)

I've taken a look at the driver and here are some global remarks:

(1) You provide dt-bindings/power-domain/rk3288.h in patch 3. This breaks
bisectability, as the driver itself in patch 2 also includes the header and
would thus fail to compile if the later patch 3 is missing.
Ideally I think the header addition should be a separate patch itself, so that
we can possibly share it between driver and dts branches.
So 1: binding doc, 2: binding-header, 3: driver, 4: dts-changes.


(2) The dts-changes in patch 3 should also add any necessary power-domain
assignment on devices if they're still missing, so that we don't introduce
regressions. In my case my work-in-progress edp died because the powerdomain
was turned off automatically it seems.


(3) more like wondering @Kevin or so, is there some more generic place for a
power-domain driver nowadays?


(4) As Tomasz remarked previously the dts should represent the hardware and
the power-domains are part of the pmu. There is a recent addition from Linus
Walleij, called simple-mfd [a] that is supposed to get added real early for
kernel 4.2. So I'd think the power-domains should use that and the patchset
modified to include the changes shown below [b]?


(5) Keven Hilman and Tomasz had reservations about all the device clocks
being listed in the power-domains itself in the previous versions. I don't see
a comment from them yet changing that view.

Their wish was to get the clocks by reading the clocks from the device nodes,
though I see a problem on how to handle devices that do not have any bindings
at all yet.

Kevin, Tomasz any new thoughts?

Subject: [PATCH] make power-domains a child of the pmu

This should of course be distributed across the original patches and not
be a separate patch.
