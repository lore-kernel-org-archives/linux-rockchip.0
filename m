I mean bascially we should get baseclk from capabilities register[15:8]
(offset 0x40@sdhci), namely EMMCCORE_CAP on TRM. Only when you get 0x0
from there, can you consider to get it from clock framework.

capabilities register[15:8] should reflect the real baseclkfreq
automatic if implemented. It's broken for rk3399 which means you should
get it via another method just as what TRM said, but not really for
other arasan IP I guess.

Well, I saw you add a return value for sdhci_arasan_syscon_write, so
should we remove it?

okay.
