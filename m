I'm testing the rockchip-efuse.c driver based on nvmem framework v8, it=
=20
works on RK3288-soc except:

1. Without the following diff, `hexdump=20
/sys/bus/nvmem/devices/rockchip-efuse0/nvmem` is wrong with "INVALID=20
ARGUMENT":

+++ b/drivers/nvmem/core.c
@@ -67,7 +67,7 @@ static ssize_t bin_attr_nvmem_read(struct file *filp,=
=20
struct kobject *kobj,
         int rc;

         /* Stop the user from reading */
-       if (pos > nvmem->size)
+       if (pos > nvmem->size - 1)
                 return 0;

         if (pos + count > nvmem->size)

RK3288-efuse has  32 x 8bit regs, in dts "reg =3D <0xffb40000 0x20>;"
Here is the message dump from nvmem_device:
[    2.158314] nvmem:
[    2.158314]           name (null)
[    2.158314]           stride 1
[    2.158314]           word_size 1
[    2.158314]           ncells 0
[    2.158314]           id 0
[    2.158314]           users 0
[    2.158314]           size 32
[    2.158314]           read_only 0

Do you think there is a leak or I'm messing up ?

2. About the read operation, eFuse data can be read during device=20
probe() and cached, OR,
     read from eFuse when needed every time. I prefer the second one bu=
t=20
then, the clock of eFuse may be
     gated. So before/after reading I have to enable/disable clk like :
           devm_clk_get(dev, "hclk_efuse256");
     The trouble is I can't find a way to get the "dev" hander in :
           static int rockchip_efuse_read(void *context, const void=20
*reg, size_t reg_size, void *val, size_t val_size)
     I am appreciated if you can give some advice.
     Or, do you think it's reasonable to add hooks before/after read in=
=20
nvmem/core.c like :
           +       before_read(dev, ...);
                    rc =3D regmap_raw_read(nvmem->regmap, pos, buf, cou=
nt);
           +       after_read(dev, ...);

3. In the /sys/bus/nvmem/devices/rockchip-efuse0/, there are files:
          /sys/devices/platform/ffb40000.efuse/rockchip-efuse0 # ls
          nvmem      of_node    power      subsystem  uevent
     Do you have a plan to add the nvmem consumers to /sys/ in nvmem=20
framework?
     For example,  in dts defined the "cpu_leakage":
         efuse: efuse@ffb40000 {
                 compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3x-efuse";
                 reg =3D <0xffb40000 0x20>;
                 #address-cells =3D <1>;
                 #size-cells =3D <1>;
                 clocks =3D <&cru PCLK_EFUSE256>;
                 clock-names =3D "pclk_efuse_256";

                 cpu_leakage: cpu_leakage {
                         reg =3D <0x17 0x1>;
                 };
         };
    Then nvmem exposes the "cpu_leakage" file in /sys which can be=20
read/write.

Thank you very much,
