Yeap, it seems it is a bug when a clock changes, but not update the=20
regs, it might make transfer failed. It was not enough to just store=20
tuning value.

So, I only just need to store tuning value in the "struct rk3x_i2c", bu=
t=20
not to store the "div_low" and "div_high"?

Okay, use &i2c->t_calc is an error here, timings shouldn't actually tak=
e=20
effect until rk3x_i2c_adapt_div().

The patches we have already used in our projects, they are verified by=20
the basic tests. I would ask them to do more tests. Because we didn't=20
change the clock rate now, it was a fixed value when clk inited, so we=20
could not find the bug here.

It would make i2c->clk to be enabled and prepared twice when uses=20
rk3x_i2c_v0_calc_timings for old hardware. But if do the opposite
disabled and unprepated twice, that is okay.
