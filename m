Personally, and I'm saying this as a user who is technical enough to fix the definitions, it took me
quite a few days to figure out what was wrong with the definitions and understand the intricate tree
of dtsi includes, to finally figure out why I couldn't just do a "status = "okay";" to enable the
UARTs... (which is roughly what is shown in several radxa supplied overlays to enable uarts on
various boards)

So my vote would be to correctly define all the hardware for a given board. Then users can simply do
a status="okay" to enable and off they go. Phrased another way, I can't see a disadvantage in doing
this, rather than leaving broken definitions in place which don't work correctly. Ideally I think
you should add at least the I2C defs as well, as that is something I would like to use for another
reason and haven't even got to the point of discovering that was broken?

I might also (gently) add that it was not easy to find all the documentation to fix this. I located
the datasheet for the Zero 3 via google (it's not obviously available on the wiki?), then there is
the reading through and I must admit I missed the multiplex difference the first few reads through.
Eventually I fed the docs into a LLM and it pointed out what I missed and we got there

So in summary, I'm hoping you will adjust the (really very well structured! thanks!) dtsi include
tree to correctly define all hardware on each board so that we don't have a situation that every
user in the world needs to be a really decent level kernel tech just to use the board! Pretty please!

Thanks for listening

Ed W
