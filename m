That is clearly a regression (even recent) a newer kernel should
not break old devicetrees and the mdio subnode creating a
mdio bus is already marked as optional.

So this will likely affect a lot more boards than the tinker board.

So if you can find the time you could try to find the offending
commit first, so that ideally the network maintainers can fix that
up.


Thanks
