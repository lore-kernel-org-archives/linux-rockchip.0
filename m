I think you could do this with no code changes to the thermal driver
if we simply convince Linus W. to apply a change that I posted up just
about a year ago.  See:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5055741/

In v1 of that patch at <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5049041/>
Linus said he liked it "A lot" and was willing to merge it with Greg
KH's Ack and with a small comment fix.  I obtained the Ack and fixed
the comment, but then the patch didn't end up being needed for me and
so I never bumped it and it got lost...

Maybe you could re-test that patch?  It looks like it has a merge
conflict with current linuxnext but it looks trivial to resolve.  You
could re-post my patch or I could repost it and you could add your
Tested-by.

You'd still want to have a bindings change to describe "init", but at
least you shouldn't need any code changes.
