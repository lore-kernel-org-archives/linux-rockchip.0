These must be represented by two cpufreq policies no matter what. That's how the
hardware is.

That should be fine.

So, right now all can go to 1.5 GHz?

Why so? I am not sure I understood this part yet. Both the clusters should try
to set their constraints and the intersection should be selected by the
regulator core? Can you share the OPP tables, so that we can discuss more.

What's wrong with all at 1.5 GHz?

No, the OPP table shouldn't be shared at all. Its something to be shared by a
cluster only.

I think it should just work, but otherwise as well we can update some framework
to make it work. Lets just get on the same line first and help me understand it
better.
