SATA does not.  SCSI devices, whether they are disks, cdroms, tape
drives or whatever have always been allocated dynamically in the
order that they are discovered.

Ethernet also does not, and davem remains opposed the idea of fixed
allocation in the kernel.

It's only a minority that demand fixed enumeration of devices.
