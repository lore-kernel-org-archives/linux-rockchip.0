The ARM Mali Midgard GPU family is present in a number of SoCs
from many different vendors such as Samsung Exynos and Rockchip.

Import the device tree bindings documentation from the r16p0
release of the Mali Midgard GPU kernel driver:

  https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/mali-drivers/kernel/mali-midgard-gpu/TX011-SW-99002-r16p0-00rel0.tgz

The following optional bindings have been omitted in this initial
version as they are only used in very specific cases:

  * snoop_enable_smc
  * snoop_disable_smc
  * jm_config
  * power_model
  * system-coherency
  * ipa-model

The example has been simplified accordingly.

The compatible string definition has been limited to
"arm,mali-midgard" to avoid checkpatch.pl warnings and to match
what the driver actually expects (as of r16p0 out-of-tree).

+ARM Mali Midgard GPU
+====================
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : Should be "arm,mali-midgard".
+- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
+- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by Mali Midgard devices.
+- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
+  provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".
+
+Optional:
+
+- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali Midgard device.
+- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".
+- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
+  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
+- operating-points : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
+  for details.
+
+Example for a Mali-T602:
+
+gpu@0xfc010000 {
+	compatible = "arm,mali-midgard";
+	reg = <0xfc010000 0x4000>;
+	interrupts = <0 36 4>, <0 37 4>, <0 38 4>;
+	interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";
+
+	clocks = <&pclk_mali>;
+	clock-names = "clk_mali";
+	mali-supply = <&vdd_mali>;
+	operating-points = <
+		/* KHz   uV */
+		533000 1250000,
+		450000 1150000,
+		400000 1125000,
+		350000 1075000,
+		266000 1025000,
+		160000  925000,
+		100000  912500,
+	>;
