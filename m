Mmh, thanks for raising this. Conceptually speaking there are two (or more)
different entities, the clocksource and the clockevents but they share the same
IP block.

In the driver timer-sp804.c there is a fragile mechanism with the timer
counting assuming the timers are declared in a specific order in the DT
(integratorcp.dts). There are multiple nodes, which are IIUC overlapping like
what you are describing.

I'm a bit puzzled with how this should be done.

Do you have a suggestion ?

Yes, that is true if no drivers was already taking CLOCKSOURCE_OF and
initializing the clockevent. The driver will pass through the clocksource_probe
function, check the interrupt and bail out because there is an interrupt
declared and assume it is a clockevent, so no initialization for the driver.
IOW, it is not backward compatible.

We need this attribute somehow in order to separate clearly a clocksource or a
clockevent with a new implementation.

Yes, there is already the bindings, but that force to do some hackish
initialization.

I would like to give the opportunity to declare separately a clocksource and a
clockevent, in order to have full control of how this is initialized.
