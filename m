Hi Mike, Stephen,

please find below rockchip clock-changes targetted at 4.14.
As we talked about before, it includes the approximation-callback
for fractional dividers, Acked by Stephen.

Apart from that we have the usual changes as described by the tag.
So if stuff looks ok, please pull.

changes in pull v2:
Compared to v1 of the pull I included some more clock-ids and
rv1108 fixes that came in meanwhile.


Thanks
Heiko

  clk: rockchip: fix the rv1108 clk_mac sel register description (2017-08-22 02:55:03 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest change is fixing the jitter on the fractional clock-type
Rockchip socs experience with the default approximation. For that we
introduce the ability to override it with a clock-specific approximation
and use that to create the needed rate settings as described in the
Rockchip soc manuals (same for all Rockchip socs).

Apart from that we have support for the rk3126 clock controller
which is similar to the rk3128 with some minimal differences
and a lot of improvements and fixes for the rv1108 clock controller
(missing clocks, some clock-ids, naming fixes, register fixes).
