okay, will simplify clk, int and rst mentioned above.

We need it in prevention of any firmwares change the default state
of #CLKREQ which is useful for ASPM. Also we have a backup pin for
clkreqn called clkreqnb, which should be taken more consideration since
when refering to any one of these two, pinctrl should configure the
bit[14] of GRF_SOC_CON7 automatically. But it is unfortunately beyound
the implementation of pinctrl-rk3399.

BTW, I don't know if we wanna support this action inside the pinctrl
code?

Basically it does. But this is an alternative choice for pcie-phy to
generate the ref_clk. When we want 100MHz src clk for PLL inside the
pcie-phy=EF=BC=8Cwe should add them, otherwise it's taken from xin 24MH=
z.

This is useful for SI testing or some others special cases. So should w=
e
add it as an option and leave a sample here?
