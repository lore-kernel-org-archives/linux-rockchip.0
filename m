My understanding is that its interpreted both by what's called BootROM
on Tegra (I guess that's what you call "maskrom code") and the system's
bootloader. The BootROM cannot typically be replaced by the OEM, but it
is quite typical for the bootloader to differ between devices.

The BootROM will interpret a subset of the bits in that register. Most
notable the "force recovery" bit. That will cause the BootROM to go into
a mode which can be used to bootstrap the device. It implements a simple
protocol (RCM) which can be used to upload a loader (usually referred to
as mini-loader) to the device's IRAM which in turn will initialize the
memory and which can download a proper bootloader (such as U-Boot) to
memory using a slightly more complex protocol (the standard protocol is
called nv3p, but the particular choice of protocol no longer matters at
this point).

The bootloader can also access this register and will interpret the
"bootloader" and "recovery" bits. On the, argueably small, sample of
Android devices I've worked with, the "bootloader" bit will make the
bootloader go into fastboot mode, whereas the "recovery" bit will make
it initiate the RCK mode, which is used to update through OTA.

There are a couple of other bits in this register, but they are badly
documented and don't seem to relate to reboot.
