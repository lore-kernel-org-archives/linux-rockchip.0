This is simply how DT works. HID-over-I2C devices are no different
than any other I2C device or any other component. You are not special.

DT describes h/w, not protocols.

When it is related to powering on the device you may need to know the
specific device in DT. Compatibles are like VID/PID for devices, a
unique identifier for the specific device. Having that does not to
prevent generic/common drivers. The same rules apply. You wouldn't
want different devices having the same VID/PID (surely that has never
happened) or only change a VID/PID when you find a bug. The same rules
apply for compatible strings. You should be able to apply quirks
without changing/adding compatible strings (or more generally, without
changing the dtb). Just like you wouldn't change a VID/PID for a
device only when you find a bug, you can't add/change a DT compatible.

BTW, As you do have a VID/PID, you could define a compatible string
syntax using VID/PID like is done for PCI and USB.
