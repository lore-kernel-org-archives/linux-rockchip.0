Hi Neil,

Thank you for your feedback. Looking over the drivers I saw that only 3 drivers
are using private of_xlate functions, the rest of them uses of_pwm_xlate_with_flags
and of_pwm_simple_xlate function combined with pwm-cells binding and of_pwm_n_cells
(which I think is redundant with pwm-cells). I though that switching to a common
of_xlate to xlate everything based on pwm-cells binding value would be better
and remove redundant code.

But if this is a downward direction I agree to drop the changes related to of_xlate.

Thanks,
Claudiu
