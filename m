Don=E2=80=99t know how to answer. For example, parent can output 768MHz,
but some IP work unstable with that parent rate. This issues was =
observed by
me and I didn=E2=80=99t get official confirmation from rockchip. So, I =
limit
such clock to 192MHz using clk_set_max_rate(). May be I have to limit =
clk rate
using another approach.

Anybody from rockchip can confirm that? Or may be contact me clarifying =
details?

Here is clock tree:

        clock                       rate
        -----                       ----
        xin24m                      24000000
          pll_gpll                    768000000
             gpll                       768000000
                i2s_src              768000000
                   i2s0_pre         192000000
                      i2s0_frac     16384000
                         sclk_i2s0  16384000

I limit i2s0_pre rate to 192MHz in order to I2S IP work properly.
rockchip_fractional_approximation() get called for i2s0_frac.
if i2s0_pre rate is 20x times less than i2s0_frac, than =
rockchip_fractional_approximation()
tries to set i2s0_pre rate to i2s_src rate. It tries to increase it=E2=80=99=
s parent rate in order
to maximise relation between nominator and denominator.

If I convert rockchip_fractional_approximation() to =
rockchip_determine_rate(), than I get
min=3D0, max=3D192MHz limits inside rockchip_determine_rate(). May be =
there should be
new logic inside clk framework based on some new clk flags, that will =
provide max=3D768MHz
for rockchip_determine_rate().

Also found, that rockchip_fractional_approximation() increase parents =
rate unconditionally
without taking into account CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag.

Stephen, thanks a lot for deep description of determine_rate() =
background. I=E2=80=99ll taking some
time thinking about possible solutions.

Regards,
Alexander.
