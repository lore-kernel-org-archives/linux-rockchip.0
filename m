I guess we could now also do a follow-up CL that starts using the GPU
as a cooling device.  Presumably it's still OK to specify this and it
will just be ignored if there's no GPU driver?  It's a little funny
because the upstream device tree uses the CPU to cool things down if
the GPU temperature sensor trips.  Downstream uses the GPU to cool
down the GPU.  ...though, of course, it's not really all that simple
since everything is packed in so tightly.

The other case that sticks as a sore thumb is the upstream
"rk3288-veyron-mickey" where all the comments still talk about the GPU
cooling but we have only the CPU cooling actually in the device tree.
:-)
