    Thanks for your suggestion.
     I have read the code you list above, if we implement the reboot=20
notifier
     driver like this, the driver need to add much more code to find th=
e=20
platform
     data(like arch/arm/mach-rockhcip/pm.c), what's more, if we have a=20
new soc
     in the future and the soc use a different register here, we need=20
modify the
     driver to add a new platform data again, this will bring additiona=
l=20
work.

     Use the DT node pass the register will make the driver code simple=
=20
and clear.
     Is there any hurt to put this information in the DT?

     Andy
