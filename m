Yes. In our SoC design, all arch (generic) timer in the same power
domain of CPU core. So if one CPU core power down, the arch (generic)
timer will lose it's state and stop working.
While rk timer maybe in peri power domain or pmu power domain, so the
timer will still work when CPU power down.

But before RK3399, all SoCs with CPU power domain, do not support auto
power down while cpu idle. So the arch timer can be seem as always on,
i.e. we don't need a broadcast timer at all.

You are right.

I don't know. Maybe Caesar do something wrong :(
This is my output:
           CPU0       CPU1       CPU2       CPU3       CPU4       CPU5
