I find it hard to believe that any host can support wake-up without
the PHY. Does this really need to be conditional? Perhaps other cases
are just always-on or remote wake-up has not been tested.

Assuming the PHY was provided with the knowledge that remote wakeup is
enabled, it would be able to figure out within its driver how to
support that. Unfortunately the generic PHY framework is a completely
lacking in its ability to support protocol specific features like this
or other USB PHY features like Vbus detect or charger detection.
