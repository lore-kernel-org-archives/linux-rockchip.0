Yes, looking at its "reasoning" output it both goes down different
investigation paths each time but more importantly it runs out of
tokens at some point, so it won't cover all the same paths each time.

I think so.. I don't want to change our process because of AI, but 
some ways to save cost rhyme with our normal recommendations.
Keep the series under 15 patches. Split the series up, and extract
trivial patches out so that they can be applied and not reposted.

Whether the comment comes from AI is secondary, so it's just a question
of whether we merge code knowing that it has issues. Rarely, I guess.
