Hi Brian,

I'm afraid you're confusing two things:
- the counter, which *must* carry on counting no matter what, as
(quoting the ARM ARM) "The system counter must be implemented in an
always-on power domain"
- the timer, which is allowed to be powered off, and can be tagged with
the "always-on" property to indicate that it is guaranteed to stay up
(which in practice only exists in virtual machines and never on real HW).

If your counter does stop counting when suspended, then this is starting
to either feel like a HW bug, or someone is killing the clock that feeds
this counter when entering suspend.

If this is the former, then we need a separate quirk to indicate the
non-standard behaviour. If it is the latter, don't do it! ;-)

Given the above, I don't think this patch is acceptable.

Thanks,
