The DT binding for the PCI version of the Marvell 8xxx wifi devices
is pretty broken (the fact that a PCI device requires a DT binding
is quite telling on its own).

The binding allows the description of a wake-up interrupt as a sideband
signal, allowing the wifi device to wake-up the system. So far, so good.
Until you realise that placing an interrupt in the PCI device DT node
has a specific meaning, and applies to the actual PCI function, and
not some random sideband stuff. This is of course in total violation
of the OF specification (IEEE Std 1275-1994), but hey, who cares.

Let's thus change the binding to be somewhat compatible with the spec,
by placing the wake-up interrupt in a subnode called "wake-up". This
still is an optional property, but a recommended one for PCI devices.
