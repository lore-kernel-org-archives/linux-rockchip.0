Thank you.  Agreed that I don't particularly like the revert and last
I checked with Shawn at Rockchip he was trying to find a better
solution.  ...but I also agree that landing the revert is better than
not landing it while we wait for a better solution.

IMHO in this particular case PHY API changes shouldn't be needed since
we should be able to use the CCF notifications.  ...but we need to
figure out how to do that in the case of the current card clock since
it's not really a fully fledged clock and doesn't support
notifications.  We might need to get advice from CCF guys...
