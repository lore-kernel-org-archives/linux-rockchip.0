nope, I was saying that the spec implies we to set clock after
setting HS_TIMING to 0x1 when doing hs400es selection.

I thought there is no difference because the spec says "Host need to
change frequency to <= 52MHz", and the f_init(<=400k) is <= 52MHz,
right? So I didn't set clock to hs_max_dtr. But I think I misunderstood
the spec, so this patch will fix this.
