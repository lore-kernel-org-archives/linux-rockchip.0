root@rockpi:~# v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev0 -l

Image Processing Controls

                     pixel_rate 0x009f0902 (int64)  : min=1 max=2147483647 step=1 default=1 value=1 flags=read-only

root@rockpi:~# v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev1 -l

Image Processing Controls

                     pixel_rate 0x009f0902 (int64)  : min=1 max=2147483647 step=1 default=1 value=1 flags=read-only

It seems that ISP heritage the control from the sensor driver. I believe it
happens because isp_dev->ctrl_handler was assigned to the v4l2_dev object:

dev.c:  v4l2_ctrl_handler_init(&isp_dev->ctrl_handler, 5);
dev.c:  v4l2_dev->ctrl_handler = &isp_dev->ctrl_handler;

Yes, but if I remove the ctrl_handler field from the struct rkisp1_isp_subdev
I don't get the error on /dev/v4l-subdev0 (ISP) anymore, I just get the error
on /dev/v4l-subdev1 (the sensor).

Here is the output of v4l2-compliance -m /dev/media0 without the
ctrl_handler field: http://ix.io/1Q9N

So from my understanding this seems to be an issue in the sensor driver that
I'm using and not in the ISP (to be verified).
I'll submit the next version without the ctrl_handler field in struct rkisp1_isp_subdev,
is that ok?

Thanks
