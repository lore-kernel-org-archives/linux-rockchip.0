The theme of this series of patches is to try to allow running the eMMC
at 150 MHz on the rk3399 SoC, though the changes should still be correct
and have merit on their own.  The motivation for running at 150 MHz is
that doing so improves signal integrity and (with some eMMC devices)
doesn't affect throughput.

These patches have been structured to keep things as separate as
possible, but nevertheless there are still some dependencies between
patches.  It probably makes the most sense for all of the non-device
tree patches to go through a single tree.  PHY patches now have Acks
from Kishon so that means things should be clear for all non-DTS patches
to go through the MMC tree if Ulf agrees.  Device tree patches should be
able to be landed separately and the worst what would happen is a
warning in the kernel log if you have the code without the device tree.

The code patches are based on Ulf's mmc-next.  In v3 of the series I've
pulled in the latest version of a previous PHY series posted by Brian
Norris.

The device tree patches are based on Heiko's v4.8-armsoc/dts64.

Changes in v3:
- Add Brian's PHY patches into my series
- Add collected tags
- Add dependency on COMMON_CLK (actually in v2.1) (Guenter Roeck)
- Use phy_init / phy_exit (Heiko)
- Add Kishon's Ack

Changes in v2:
- Drop 170 MHz comment (only applicable to a subtly different Arasan PHY)
- Indicate that 5.1 ms is calculated (Shawn).
- Clean up description of rk3399 PHY (Shawn)
- Add Rob Herring's Ack.
- Reorder includes (Shawn)
- Adjust commit message wording (Rob)
- List out clocks and clock names (Rob)
- Move code cleanup before set phyctrl_frqsel based on card clock (Shawn)
- Warn if we're more than 15 MHz from ideal rate (Shawn)
- Fix typo USB => SDHCI (Shawn)
