     Okay, I will move to drivers/power/reset next version.

     Okay, syscon is better.

     Okay, thanks for your suggestion.  I will add the reboot-mode.c as=
=20
the core library, syscon-reboot-mode.c as one example first. As for=20
sram/dram/nvram case, I am not familiar with them, so hope there are=20
some hero will extend them when needed.
