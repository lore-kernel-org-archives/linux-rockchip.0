The potential regression that I'm referring to would be caused by
inversing the sequence (GPIO enable -> PWM enable). That's completely
unrelated to the delays introduced by this patch. Many boards use this
driver and they've been running with the old sequence for many years.
Granted, it's fairly unlikely to regress, but it's still a possibility.

Given that both changes are logically separate, I think separate patches
are totally appropriate. I also don't think that this would overly
complicate things.
