I still have no idea why checking (in a broken way) that the link
is up for _every_ given config access is a solution.

If, say, the link is down in xilinx_pcie_init_port(), what would bring
it up or, worded differently, why checking that the link is up for every
config access instead of host bridge probe time make this code any safer
?

It is not safe anyway, it would be good to understand though why the code
was written this way so that we can change it appropriately.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
