which would be very strange, because we could use H4 instead of H5.

Asking for comment should be mark with RFC in the patch subject.

As we already linked the RK808 clock in the sdio pwrseq, we shouldn't do this here again.

reset-gpios isn't compatible to hci_h5, please use my preliminary dt-binding

AFAIK hci_h5 doesn't support host-wake yet. So if you want to keep for the future we should make a comment.

Please drop these as the driver doesn't use it and it's already linked in the sdio pwrseq.

Thanks Stefan
