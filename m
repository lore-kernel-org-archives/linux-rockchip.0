Indeed it's not, but we could probably handle that if absolutely needed
(get a reference to the root port pci_dev somehow, then use the existing
helpers to walk children and get the computed ->pcie_cap offset). But
that's not the problem here; we have 5 GT/s devices, but they are not
running at 5 GT/s because link training can't pass. We have been told
there are still SI issues, and so you wouldn't really be able to turn
this out at runtime anyway.

But sure, I suppose that'd be a way to (for chips/boards that don't have
SI issues) determine whether or not to attempt gen2 training at all.
That does sound better than just timing out after 500ms...

Thanks.
