Hi Elaine,

that's a bit ambigous, having the Signed-offs like above.

Either you are the author+sender of the patch, then Finley's
Signed-off should go away ... or Finley is the author and you
are the sender, then the author of the patch should be set
correctly (--author option for git) and the Signed-offs should
switch places (= Finley first, then yours). Please fix.

This seems to be true for most patches in this series.

Here I have a naming question. When looking at the vendor kernel
it looks like the px30 is largely related to the rk3326.
(rk3326.dtsi includeing the px30.dtsi)

What is the reason for basing the naming on the px30 this time? And could
we possibly keep to rkXXXX names for the basic things in the kernel, thus
keeping the pxXX as second name, like with the other px-variants before?


Thanks
Heiko
