Tying it to a Linux ABI makes the binding Linux specific. I don't have a 
problem that the strings happen to be the same, but we should have some 
understanding that they may not be and allow for that.

Okay, as long as they are clearly documented what they mean.

Well, you could still have "rockchip,mode-rockchip-bl-download"... 

We can bikeshed that when get there.

The other way random custom modes could be done is just allow the raw 
value to be passed from userspace converting the string to a number. 
Then we have no abstraction rather than half way abstracting it.

So much for standards. However, while these specific modes have not been 
standardized, there is a set of standard modes and these could have been 
added to the existing mechanism. So there at least exists some model to 
draw inspiration from.
