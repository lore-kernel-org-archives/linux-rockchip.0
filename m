We make microphone arrays with lots of microphones.  Some as few as 2, =
many with 7 channels, and a few with 14 or more. =20

Can you support 8 channels with 32 bits/sample?  That would work, we ca=
n just set the codecs for 16-bit samples, which would be 256 bits/frame=
=2E

Hope you had a great golden week holiday!

Thanks, =20
