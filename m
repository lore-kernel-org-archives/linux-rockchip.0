Hmph, the same patch[1] has been sitting in my inbox for months
now but I never got a response to my last question and then
forgot about it. I'll repeat the question here and hopefully we
can finish the discussion.

Maybe it would make more sense to have different ops for read
only dividers? The clk_set_rate op would be empty, while we would
have proper recalc_rate and round_rate ops. We can't just flat
out revert commit e6d5e7d90be9 (clk-divider: Fix READ_ONLY when
divider > 1, 2014-11-14) because that will introduce the problem
that it was fixing, but as long as we implement round_rate in
addition to recalc_rate it should work.
