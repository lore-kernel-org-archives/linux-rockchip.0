This matches my understanding of the code more or less.

This fixes the Common Clock bit for me, with ASPM enabled on the Google
Kevin board; and my EndPoint (Marvell 8997) even reports a lower ASPM
L0s latency now. Nice! Thanks for the patch.

Personally, I might even mark this as:

Fixes: b8ab8e041cc0 ("PCI: rockchip: Mark RC as common clock architecture")

Not that it necessarily deserves -stable, but it helps people browsing
the logs, and wondering why the above commit doesn't seem to take effect
:)
