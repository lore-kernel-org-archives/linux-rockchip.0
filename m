I would prefer that you restructure this series a bit.

Start by adding each new MMC_CAP2* separately and without involving
the DT parsing.

Make the DT documentation patch come after the above, and add a new
separate patch which exposes the caps to device tree.

In that way, I can pick up the non DT parts and wait for Rob's
ack/nack of the DT bindings.

Kind regards
