If regulator_set_voltage_triplet() is ever implemented more correctly
then the description here is correct.  ...the problem is that
regulator_set_voltage_triplet() is still using the same shortcut that
regulator_set_voltage_tol() was using.

The idea is that since this is intended to be called by
start_signal_voltage_switch() and having no vqmmc should be considered
an error for start_signal_voltage_switch() then it should be an error
here.  What do you think?

The whole fact that there are two calls here is really just because of
the limitations of the current implementation of
regulator_set_voltage_triplet().  If that implementation is ever fixed
then we'd just need a single call.  Probably worth a comment saying
that?
