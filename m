Oops, my mistake, it's just a regular WARN() at 
drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_helper.c:1348 - the IRQs I'm 99% sure were 
from dw-hdmi (I really should stop doing this way past bedtime then 
trying to remember the details days later...)

I'll turn on all the debug options and do some more digging over the 
weekend (and actually save some logs this time!)
