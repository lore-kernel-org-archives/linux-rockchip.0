I'm a bit torn here.  I like the idea of actually getting 60 Hz and
you also increase the vblank time by a little bit (which means that if
anyone ever gets DDRFreq upstream it will work better).  ...but I'm
also slightly nervous changing something like this without a really
good motivation.  As you said in your commit message the pixels clocks
claimed by the spec don't actually all work and thus, to some extent,
we can only rely on trial-and-error here.  While your new mode works
well on your device (and you wisely gave it a bit of margin), it is
_possible_ that there could be devices out there where it doesn't work
(especially across various temperature extremes).  All devices were
tested in the factory with the old timings and presumably have been
running fine for years like that...

I will certainly admit that it's unlikely devices would be affected,
but at the same time I'd want to know how much of a difference going
from 58.3 Hz to 60 Hz made for you.  Could you actually notice any
visible difference, or was it just nice to be at 60 Hz?
