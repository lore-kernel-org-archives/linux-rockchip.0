Yes.  I just meant that we don't know the specific capabilities of the
host bridge, and firmware or the native driver may not have configured
it in the optimal way.

I'd like to hear Vidya's thoughts on this first in case I'm
misinterpreting something.

In the meantime, I think it's not terrible if you leave this as-is for
now.  Worst-case we'll get some warnings that we might not need, but
IIUC, patches 2/4 and 3/4 don't fix a functional problem.

I don't know whether the IORESOURCE_PREFETCH bit on host bridge
windows is important or not.  I *think* it's common for ACPI host
bridge descriptions to have no windows described as "prefetchable" (at
least, my garden-variety laptop has none):

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xfd000000-0xfe7fffff window]
  pci 0000:00:01.0: PCI bridge to [bus 01]
  pci 0000:00:01.0:   bridge window [mem 0xc0000000-0xd1ffffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:00:1c.1: PCI bridge to [bus 03]
  pci 0000:00:1c.1:   bridge window [mem 0xd2100000-0xd2afffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:00:1d.6: PCI bridge to [bus 06-3e]
  pci 0000:00:1d.6:   bridge window [mem 0x90000000-0xb1ffffff 64bit pref]

I guess we must just rely on the fact that BIOS has already programmed
those prefetchable windows?  I really don't know how this works, to be
honest.
