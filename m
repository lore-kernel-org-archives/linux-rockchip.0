I also agree that this section of current get_temp is buggy. That is why 
I sent the patch some time ago.

Yes, Brian, we are concerned about the same bug.

Yeah, but that is why we need people to look the code considering all
features. :-)

I do not remember why Rui postponed it. A note of clarification, for
things that touch thermal core, I agree with Rui that they go through
his tree. Besides, I tend to avoid acking and sending my own patches
without proper review, which was not the case of that patch, that was
just postponed and fell into the cracks somehow.

Yeah sure. I have at least three extra patch sets on thermal core on
my queue. But I would like to get first the thermal sysfs reorg in
first. This fix is one of the changes that will go on top of the thermal
sysfs reorg.

BR,
