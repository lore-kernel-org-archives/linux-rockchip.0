The caller is performing one abstract operation: reading or writing
config space of a PCI device.  In the caller's context, it makes no
difference whether it's a type0 or type1 access.

Moving the test from the host bridge driver to pci_read_config_byte()
does move a little code from the callee to the caller, and there are
more callees than callers, so in that sense it does remove code
overall.  If you consider a single driver by itself, I'm not sure it
makes much difference.

The pcie-designware.c patch is a net removal of 17 lines, but that's
not all from moving the type0/type1 test: restructuring along the same
lines but keeping the original type0/type1 test removes about 9 lines.

Anyway, I think I'd rather work first on your RFC patches to make
pci_host_bridge the primary structure for probing PCI.  I think
there will be a *lot* of benefit there.
