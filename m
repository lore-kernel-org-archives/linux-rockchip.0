Hello!

Forgot to mention transfer hags happen only on mem to dev transfers (dma =
writes to
device) and never on dev to mem.

Yea, I know, rk3188 and earlier are quite ancient, but we made custom =
hardware
based on rk3188 and some of our customers report problems.

For testing I use rk3188 based custom board with eMMC (probably =
rk3188-radxa rock
with SD can also be used for testing) with cpufreq	enabled.

For testing I made simple script, that do in loop following:
1. Creates 6 new empty partitions using mkfs.ext3 about 1Gb total
2. extract 100MB archive of linux image to 512Mb partition (about 400MB =
extracted size).
3. sleep random time from 60 to 120 sec

CPU load looks like that:
cpufreq stats: 312 MHz:32.63%, 504 MHz:0.00%, 600 MHz:0.00%, 816 =
MHz:0.38%, 1.01 GHz:29.83%, 1.20 GHz:0.38%, 1.42 GHz:0.00%, 1.61 =
GHz:36.79%  (494481)

This test can run for 6 hours and than transfer can hang. I used 5 =
devices to test. Some
devices may run test for long time, but some may fail within an hour.

I played with CPU clock settings in u-boot and mmc bus clock settings =
dts file. I tried to lower eMMC bus
clock frequency to exclude PCB errors. Found that some combinations of =
settings
make my test run longer, but test fail anyway.

Also I found, that making following change to dw_mmc, result in high =
error count:

                /* TRANS_MODE_PIO */
                mmc->max_segs =3D 64;

With this settings mmc core split large transfer to multiply item =
scatterlists and
increase scatterlists  switching rate inside pl330. So I assumed that =
the root of problem
is dma goes out of sync with device.

For, example, there is a patch in mainline linux:
=
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/dr=
ivers/dma/pl330.c?h=3Dv5.0.3&id=3D1d48745b192a7a45bbdd3557b4c039609569ca41=

It fix the problem EDMA can get out of sync with device. But the patch =
don=E2=80=99t work for rk3188, because
rk3188 has PL330_QUIRK_BROKEN_NO_FLUSHP quirk.

I=E2=80=99ll try to backport EDMA driver from vendor 4.4 kernel and =
report test result.

Problem safer to fix patching dw_mmc code, than pl330 code. Because
patch change transfer parameters from known to work values:

                mmc->max_segs =3D 64;
                mmc->max_blk_size =3D 65535;
                mmc->max_blk_count =3D 65535;
                mmc->max_req_size =3D
                               mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
                mmc->max_seg_size =3D mmc->max_req_size;

to

		mmc->max_segs =3D 1;
		mmc->max_blk_size =3D 65535;
		mmc->max_blk_count =3D 64 * 512;
		mmc->max_req_size =3D
				mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
		mmc->max_seg_size =3D mmc->max_req_size;
