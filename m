It's indeed what I suspected. I don't dabble in U-Boot very often, but I seem
to recall it has fixed room for 2 MAC addresses and that would explain the
symptom/problem I described.

I'm going to give it a try and see what happens.

Haha! You linked in that thread to Heiko's RK356X OTP patch set and I tested
that hoping/assuming that could help with generating unique MAC addresses.
I see (or think I do) pieces of the puzzle, but I don't know how they all
fit together.

They all use the RTL8125BG and I suspect that plays a role in it.

Awesome, thanks :-)
