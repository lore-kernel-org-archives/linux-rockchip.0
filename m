Hello!

This is the series of patches that will add support for the Cadence's DPI/DP
bridge. Please note that this is a preliminary version of the driver and there
will be more patches in the future with updates, fixes and improvements.
Please keep that in mind when looking at FIXME/TODO/XXX comments.

Initially, MHDP driver was developed as a DRM bridge driver and was planed to
be placed in drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/mhdp.c.  However, there was already
a driver for Cadence's DP controller developed by RockChip, but that driver
uses the different DRM framework and looks like a part of a bigger system.
Both controllers (including firmware) are quite different internally
(MST/FEC/DSC support, link training done by driver, additional commands, IRQ's
etc.) but they have similar register map, except for Framer/Streamer (which is
noticeably different), so they appear similar.

The following patches contain:
- Moving common code to drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/cdns-mhdp-common.* and
  modifying it a bit (mostly new prefixes for functions and data types) so it
  can be used by two, higher level, drivers.
- Modifying existing RockChip's DP driver to use the common code after changes
  made to it (use the new cdns_mhdp_device structure and new function names).
- Modifying DRM helpers a bit. Some are required for new driver, some are
  updates from DP 1.2 to 1.3 or 1.4.
- Adding documentation for device tree bindings.
- Adding preliminary Cadence DPI/DP bridge driver.

Some of the things that will be added later on include (but are not limited
to):
- Support for Cadence SD0801 PHY (PHY's driver should be on the way by now)
- SST audio support
- MST support
- DSC support
- FEC support
- HDCP support

Changes in v2:
- Added actual description of what the patch contains, what is it for and
  what's going on here in general.
- New structure. Now we have one common low level driver + two high level
  drivers - one for RockChip with minimum changes and one, more general, for
  Cadence.
- Dropped some changes made to DRM helpers.
- Updated the device tree bindings document.
