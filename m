Actually I meant lscpi found the common clock was cleared but we have
set it in RC's driver.

yes.

It sounds good.

It's okay to just set SLC in RC's driver and let aspm code decide the
CCC bit, so I will respin v2 to fix this for rockchip RC.

Then we could go on talking about another issue that should we need to
set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_CCC on both ends if possbile? I think we need more
evidence from the spec which states that it could benefit for something
else than aspm's latency. However I didn't them.
