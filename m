I tend to disagree with this approach. A fan is not a led and the devicetree 
is about describing the hardware, not how a specific kernel likes to use things 
:-) .

The kernel already has a gpio-fan driver (drivers/hwmon) or you could 
resurrect the gpio-pwm patch [0] from Olliver Schinagl and use the pwm-fan on 
top of that for more intermediate steps.

At least cpufreq is already hooked to the thermal controller on the rk3288, so 
even without additional cooling it should select lower cpu frequencies keeping 
the heat in line and prevent overheating the board.

Both solutions shown above also hook into the thermal framework and act as 
cooling device according real temperature readings from the chip and not 
trying to determine some sort of cooling from load in a somewhat hacky way.
