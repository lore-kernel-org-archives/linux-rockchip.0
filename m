I was scratching my head for a bit where this was affecting the evb, until I 
found the include at the end of patch5 :-) .

Yep, it was at least booting :-) . I guess I should wire it up again. My shiny 
new Gru somehow did take up its space recently.

That somehow sounds unrelated, as this patch only touches gru stuff anyway. So 
if the evb breaks, it would do so after patch5 already.

So I guess going forward we could do, describe the evb pwm regulators (in 
disabled state), add general OPPs, add gru with pwm regulators?

I'll try to hook up my evb and check on the pwm-regulators in the schematics 
this week.
