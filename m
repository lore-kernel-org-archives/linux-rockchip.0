From what I understood this is the name of the card that will be shown
by Alsa, including these displayed by aplay -L . The problem is this
driver will connect a cpu dai to multicodecs, one of these is an analog
output while the other one is a digital output... I am not sure that we
can really expose a different name.

Ok, I will change that.
