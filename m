Yeah, this is what our experience with Mesa (in particular) has taught us.

Having 100% of the tests pass 100% of the time on 100% of the platforms 
is a great goal that everyone should aim for. But it will also never happen.

Firstly, we're just not there yet today. Every single GPU-side DRM 
driver has userspace-triggerable faults which cause occasional errors in 
GL/Vulkan tests. Every single one. We deal with these in Mesa by 
retrying; if we didn't retry, across the breadth of hardware we test, 
I'd expect 99% of should-succeed merges to fail because of these 
intermittent bugs in the DRM drivers. We don't have the same figure for 
KMS - because we don't test it - but I'd be willing to bet no driver is 
100% if you run tests often enough.

Secondly, we will never be there. If we could pause for five years and 
sit down making all the current usecases for all the current hardware on 
the current kernel run perfectly, we'd probably get there. But we can't: 
there's new hardware, new userspace, and hundreds of new kernel trees. 
Even without the first two, what happens when the Arm SMMU maintainers 
(choosing a random target to pick on, sorry Robin) introduce subtle 
breakage which makes a lot of tests fail some of the time? Do we refuse 
to backmerge Linus into DRM until it's fixed, or do we disable all 
testing on Arm until it's fixed? When we've done that, what happens when 
we re-enable testing, and discover that a bunch of tests get broken 
because we haven't been testing?

Thirdly, hardware is capricious. 'This board doesn't make it to u-boot' 
is a clear infrastructure error, but if you test at sufficient scale, 
cold solder or failing caps surface way more often than you might think. 
And you can't really pick those out by any other means than running at 
scale, dealing with non-binary results, and looking at the trends over 
time. (Again this is something we do in Mesa - we graph test failures 
per DUT, look for outliers, and pull DUTs out of the rotation when 
they're clearly defective. But that only works if you actually run 
enough tests on them in the first place to discover trends - if you stop 
at the first failed test, it's impossible to tell the difference between 
'infuriatingly infrequent kernel/test bug?' and 'cracked main board 
maybe?'.)

What we do know is that we _can_ classify tests four ways in 
expectations. Always-passing tests should always pass. Always-failing 
tests should always fail (and update the expectations if you make them 
pass). Flaking tests work often enough that they'll always pass if you 
run them a couple/few times, but fail often enough that you can't rely 
on them. Then you just skip tests which exhibit catastrophic failure 
i.e. local DoS which affects the whole test suite.

By keeping those sets of expectations, we've been able to keep Mesa 
pretty clear of regressions, whilst having a very clear set of things 
that should be fixed to point to. It would be great if those set of 
things were zero, but it just isn't. Having that is far better than the 
two alternatives: either not testing at all (obviously bad), or having 
the test always be red so it's always ignored (might as well just not test).


Cheers,

Daniel
