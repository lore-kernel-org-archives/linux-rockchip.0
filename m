This is a patch adding a device driver.  We do not require that patches
adding device drivers also add architecture code to load the driver or
even be part of the same patch series since that isn't really helpful
for anything.  We don't even require that board code be part of mainline
at all, though obviously we do encourage it.

If you want to make a tree wide effort to remove MODULE_ALIAS()s that
do not have any in tree users please do that separately.  Right now it's
perfectly OK to do it.
