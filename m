     Thank you for your inspiration. I think i can handle ddrc clk like 
the armclk.
     About the dfi, it will monitor ddr utilization, according this 
result to do
     ddr frequency scaling. I think i can implement a dfi drvier, and 
register it to devfreq,
     then call the dmc_set_rate fucntion in the dfi drvier, meanwhile i 
will implement a ddrc clk driver
     like the armclk, implement set rate funciton, and call the 
dcf(implement in ATF) in this function.
