I _think_ what Caesar means is that the alternative to this patch is
to leave the clocks on all the time as they were during the early days
of Rockchip (AKA last year).  If the clocks are on all the time then
the power domain patches can work fine.  However, once you start
letting clocks turn off then you need to make sure that the power
domain code turns the back on temporarily.

It's been a long time and I don't know that I've reviewed every
revision of this series, but I think there was a proposal that we
shouldn't list clocks here.  Instead we should search through and find
all devices that refer to this power domain, reach in and find their
clocks, and turn them on.  Did I get that right?  To put things in a
concrete way, for pd_vio we'd go through the entire device tree
ourselves and find all properties that look like "power-domains =
<&power RK3288_PD_VIO>;".  We'd then find the parent of those
properties and look for a property named "clocks".  We'd then iterate
over all those clocks and turn those on.  Did I get that right?

The above doesn't seem like a terribly great idea to me for a number
of reasons, including:

1. If I remember correctly, it's important to turn on clocks for
devices even if they're not something you're using / have a driver
for.  If you don't then the device won't get reset properly and this
can affect things like suspend/resume because the hardware in the SoC
will query all devices at suspend time to make sure they're ready.  If
a device is wedged because its clock wasn't on at the right them then
it will cause problems.

2. If we absolutely need to turn all clocks and we get clocks from
device tree nodes on then it means we need device tree nodes for every
device in the domain.  These would be needed even if there are no
accepted bindings for this device yet.  So we'd need to do one of: A)
Block power domain patches on feature complete bindings for all
drivers; B) Make up non-approved compatible strings for all devices
and throw them into the DTS; C) Add nodes in the DTS without a
compatible string just to satisfy the power domain requirements.  None
of these seem terribly appealing.

3. It is entirely possible that there are clocks that will be listed
in the individual devices that aren't needed for powering on the power
domain.  I'd tend to believe that PCLK_EDP_CTRL (the pixel clock)
doesn't really need to be turned on when adjusting the "VIO" power
domain.  Right now Caesar has it listed, but it probably isn't needed
(Caesar: can you confirm?).

4. It seems just slightly brittle to be reaching into other device
nodes and making assumptions about their properties.  Yeah, it's
probably safe to assume that "clocks" has a list of clocks and
"power-domains" will point to something whose first entry is a
phandle, but it still seems just a tad bit like violating an
abstraction barrier.


Anyway, perhaps I'm misunderstanding, or perhaps my concerns are
simply not for important things.  If so feel free to yell at me.  ;)

I suppose the SoC could override things and make sure clocks are on in
this case?  ...or if a clock is off it could defer powering it up
somehow until the clock came on?  ...dunno how this actually looks in
hardware.  In any case letting devices get wedged doesn't seem
ideal...
