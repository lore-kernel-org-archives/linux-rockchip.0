For non-security, the same with rk3036 SoC, we use rk3036-smp method to 
bring-up cores, and for security, we use arm-psci method.
As security become more and more important and required, we would prefer 
using arm-psci method, and it is also an easy way to use.

No, they are the same. How about I move these changes to rk322x.dtsi?

Ah, it is included in op-tee :-)
