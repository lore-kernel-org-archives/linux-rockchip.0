I think the preference has been to put these under drivers/soc/<vendor>=
 for now,
so they can shared across arm32 and arm64.

Correct. =20

I don't see any issues with devices that don't have bindings, as all
that would be needed would be to simple device nodes with a clock
property.  I wouldn't even matter if those devices had device drivers.
