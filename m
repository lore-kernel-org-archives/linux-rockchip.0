sdhci doesn't call clk_set_rate to explicitly assign clk_xin to 200MHz
as it always assumes sdhci controller should meet the highest speed of
each timing mode. And the internal divider will be used. So IMHO,
clk-rockchip for 3399 *haven't* made clk_xin to be 200MHz. Let's assign
the clk stuff to make sure it's 200MHz.

Another problem is that emmc_phy contains a configuration which should
be consistent with clk_out(namely clk_xin/internal dividor). Now I don't
submit unpstream patchset to expose these configurarion, but in
prevention of some misleading, I think it's better to to it.

How about adding these?

assigned-clocks = <&cru SCLK_EMMC>;
assigned-clock-parents = <&cru PLL_CPLL>; //may not need
assigned-clock-rates = <200000000>;

Still you limit your clk_out by adding max-frequency in dts for
specific requirment.

We here manually assigne the clk_xin to be 200MHz, so defaultly
when it's runing in HS200/HS400(ES) mode, internal divider won't
be used(by-pass mode). So the clk jitter is better when by-passing the
clock.

Thanks.
