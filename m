You seem to be using a convention by which the port represents the
whole "slot" or "PCI device" (as an entity consisting of up to 8
functions) connected to it.

That is fair enough as long as the port is not the top of a more
complex branch of the PCIe hierarchy, so maybe that case needs to be
made special somehow?

Also, I would document the convention by mentioning that the wakeup
signaled via that interrupt doesn't apply to the port itself, but to
the functions (endpoints) below it.

As long as the convention used here is clear to everybody, that is.

Thanks,
