Trying to read config space of a device that doesn't exist is an
essential part of enumeration, and we expect whatever error occurs at
the hardware level to get turned into 0xffffffff data at the CPU (as
in pci_bus_read_dev_vendor_id()).

Shawn mentioned some issue with memory read/write as well.  I think we
need to sort out how to handle both the config space issue and the
memory issue.  This patch seems like it papers over part of it and
reduces the urgency of finding a real solution.

I'm going to drop this for now, pending a more detailed explanation.
