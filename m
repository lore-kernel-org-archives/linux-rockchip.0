Hi Alexander,

sorry, I will rewrite the description because of the grammatical errors. I
don't want to give you the feeling I'm lecturing you, my English is not perfect
but it will be simpler to give the full descr with the typos fixed.

"
The clocksource and the sched_clock provided by the arm_global_timer are quite
unstable because their rates depend on the cpu frequency.

On the other side, the arm_global_timer has a higher rating than the
rockchip_timer, it will be selected by default by the time framework while
we want to use the stable rockchip clocksource.

Let's disable the arm_global_timer in order to have the rockchip clocksource
selected by default.
"

This patch should go at the end of the patchset when the clocksource is
implemented in the rockchip_timer.
