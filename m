Hi Robin,

An interesting suggestion - no it hasn't been tried to always set the 
vccio_sd regulator on. Will give it a go on ArchLinux Arm.

I guess this would explain why the Tinker Board booting from sd doesn't 
see the error, as its enabled probably in uboot and then keeps working.

IIRC though, if booting the TBS from eMMC, then inserting an sd card and 
the errors stop. I guess this wouldn't happen if the power wasn't applied?

I guess also that "regulator-always-on" is a quick test - but that for 
submission to kernel it would be better done via "mmc-pwrseq-simple"?

Anyway I set up a test - so we can confirm this.

David.
