(Synopsis -> Synopsys :))

Trying to catch up with the conversation:

1) In AHB audio mode the bits are always reserved.
2) I think we should enable/disable clock instead of just forcing
N/CTS, though, I don't know what could be the implications for
iMX platform. I remember at the time I tested this using I2S
(I've never used AHB), and HDMI protocol analyzers were
complaining about the N/CTS being forced to zero.
3) I also remember that there was something wrong with the N
calculations (I had to remove the if for pixel clock ==
25175000). I never submited a patch to that because I was running
out of time and didn't investigate this further (it could be for
example a problem specific to my setup).

Hope it helps a little bit.

Best regards,
Jose Miguel Abreu
