Sigh. Ok. It seemed it was due to earlier comments (maybe from others,
but I thought it was you), that we moved from specifying a command
string, to using the label. But if you think the label name and the
commands shouldn't be linked, it seems like we should re-introduce
that. No?

Unless your thinking we need some sort of static in-kernel mapping of
commands to label names? But that just seems painfully indirect for
little gain ("Its obvious! For that mode, you use this term here, and
that different term over there!").

True. But as I think we agreed below, "bootloader" and "recovery" are
basically defacto standards, and I think it would be a bad idea to try
to declare all the existing android tooling and docs wrong just
because the command is vague, technically.

That part sounds sane, although I do think having vendor prefixes are
reasonable for actual commands as well.

Well, there's a partial standard there.  I'm told for android on x86,
there is no UEFI standard way to communicate rebooting to fastboot or
recovery. Every device does its own device specific driver.

Ok.

Andy: Can you comment here? How critical are the specific commands
you've used here for your userspace?

True.

Fair enough. I just want to make sure we're not getting too caught up
with design purity and are willing the meet the world where it is.

Maybe? I'm not sure what might have trouble with reboot failing if it
sticks any extra noise in the reboot command.
I'd probably lean towards sticking with the existing behavior.

Heh. I guess. Thought I suspect "Just read the DT to sort out the
available reboot modes" is probably not what most userspace wants to
hear. :)
