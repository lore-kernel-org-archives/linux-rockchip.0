The patch add two timers to all rk3188 based boards.

The first timer is from alive subsystem and it act as a backup
for the local timers at sleep time. It act the same as other
SoC rockchip timers already present in kernel.

The second timer is from CPU subsystem and act as replacement
for the arm-global-timer clocksource and sched clock. It run
at stable frequency 24MHz.
