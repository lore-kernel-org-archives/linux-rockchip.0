Yes, the pclk_vio_grf is needed for doing video output.
andpclk_vio_grf supply for: grf_soc_con9, 20~26, grf_hdcp

 From our design folks, we have many GRF registers in different power=20
domains,
and these GRF gates should be always enabled. In this case, we can avoi=
d=20
some
of the operations GRF registers exception problems, and it is only a=20
very small
increase in  power consumption (aboult <=3D1ma).

I will refer the latest TRM to update a new patch for always enable=20
these GRFs.

Please drop this patch.

Thanks.
