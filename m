Using PSCI on more rockchip socs will make the ARM people very happy ;-) .

So definitly no argument from me against it. I guess you should only need the 
enable-method and psci node you should already have in your 3.10 dts, to 
actually enable it.

cpu@xxx {
		enable-method = "psci";
};

psci {
	compatible = "arm,psci-0.2";
	...
};


But we can of course add that in a later patch as well.
