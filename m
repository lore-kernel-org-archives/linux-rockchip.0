The displayport-phy is fully enclosed in the general register files (GRF).
Therefore as seen from the device-tree it shouldn't be a separate platform-
device but instead a sub-device of the GRF - using the simply-mfd mechanism.

The driver entered the kernel in the current merge-window, so we can still
adapt the binding without needing a fallback, as the binding hasn't been
released with a full kernel yet.

While the edp phy is fully part of the GRF, it doesn't have any separate
register set there, so doesn't get any register-area assigned.

While one of my intermediate versions did include that conversion
already, it looks like it was lost when the dp-phy got split out into
its own series and I missed that dropped change.

As mentioned in the patch description above, this is meant as a fixup for
kernel 4.6.
