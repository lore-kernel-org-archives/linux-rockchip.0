Now that's a lovely typo - (GNU vs GUN) :-)

But seriously - what makes you think that the kernel does not allow
MIT/X11 licensed code ? Most of the DRM subsystem uses it.

I would suggest keeping the license the same in both places (the
libdrm ones should be a direct copy of the kernel one produced with
`make headers_install`), regardless of which one you opt for.

Already mentioned elsewhere but for posterity:

If designing a new interface one should provide a reference to a
maintained upstream project, where the design was approved. Reason
being is that unlike ChromeOS's kernel upstream one gets to keep its
interfaces forever. And yes, I realise that CrOS folks are trying
really hard to upstream things and use vanilla kernel.
