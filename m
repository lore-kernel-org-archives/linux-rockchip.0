Do you mean that revise the similar timing in mmc_hs400_to_hs200()as=20
shown below?

The spec doesn't require mode selection from hs400 to hs200, moreover I=
=20
have not yet hit any failure in mmc_hs400_to_hs200.
Thus I don't know whether a fix is needed for re-tuning.
By the way, what's your opinion for this patch?   I know, you did it on=
=20
purpose that I found some message from git log.
