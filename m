As you SoC don't use removable card, let's just leave this for now.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Yes, that's fine. I would thus expect that you want to do phy power
off/on from the runtime PM callbacks, right!?

If that's the case I think $subject patch should deal with *both* phy
init and phy power on during ->probe().

Kind regards
