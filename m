Let's document the display timings that jerry has been using out in
the field.  This uses the standard blankings but a slightly slower
clock rate, thus getting a refresh rate 58.3 Hz.

NOTE: this won't really do anything except cause DRM to properly
report the refresh rate since vop_crtc_mode_fixup() was rounding the
pixel clock to 74.25 MHz anyway.  Apparently the adjusted rate isn't
exposed to userspace so it's important that the rate we're trying to
achieve is mostly right.

For the downstream kernel change related to this see See
https://crrev.com/c/324558.

NOTE: minnie will be fixed up in a future patch, so for now we'll just
delete the panel timings there.
