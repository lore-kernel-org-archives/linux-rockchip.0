I was planning on submitting those two patches after the PWM changes
have been merged, but you're right, maybe we should think about a proper
way to smoothly get all of them in the same release.

I have rebased my work on top your regulator/topic/pwm branch containing
Lee's work [1].

Note that patch 1 has changed a bit to take Lee's additions into
account.

Thierry, could you create a branch based on Mark's regulator/topic/pwm
branch ?
If everybody agrees on the solution I'll send a v3 rebasing my work on
top of this topic branch.

Best Regards,

Boris
