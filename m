Actually, I always remember it should be without placeholders from the 
first time you commented :-)
but I saw that the binding and driver (rockchip,rk322x-efuse) have 
already been applied, so I send this one keep the same with driver side.
Shall I resend a new patch to correct both of them to 
'rockchip,rk3228-efuse' ?
