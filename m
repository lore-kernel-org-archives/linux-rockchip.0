Hi,

I think Doug is probably right on most accounts, and I haven't
thoroughly investigated all the claims. But a few thoughts:

When you say "suspend" do you mean USB runtime suspend (i.e., auto
suspend) or do you mean system suspend (i.e., driver .suspend()
callbacks)? The latter are empty intentionally for PHY drivers, since
PHY state is managed by the consumer driver (i.e., the controller
driver). And the former doesn't actually disable any clocks AFAIK, so
that's a red herring IIUC.

That may well be true. There isn't a single defined probe order as soon
as you involve async probe, right? So things get a little fuzzier. Also,
I know if you're talking about async suspend/resume, the driver core
only (until quite recently? [1]) respects parent/child relationships.
But I'm not sure of all the async details right now, and async suspend
isn't typically used for the controllers AFAIK -- just for the
hubs/devices.

Anyway, I don't think that's relevant at all because:

Right, PHY drivers don't do anything at suspend/resume, since I guess
they presume the consuming driver (the controller) will handle state
transitions (power off, exit).

Random thing I noticed: there seems to be a race in
phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.c, if we're worried about the 480M clock getting
disabled too early. See:

static int rockchip_usb2phy_power_off(struct phy *phy)
{
...
        clk_disable_unprepare(rphy->clk480m);
...
}

static int rockchip_usb2phy_exit(struct phy *phy)
{
        struct rockchip_usb2phy_port *rport = phy_get_drvdata(phy);

        if (rport->port_id == USB2PHY_PORT_OTG &&
            rport->mode != USB_DR_MODE_HOST) {
                cancel_delayed_work_sync(&rport->otg_sm_work);
                cancel_delayed_work_sync(&rport->chg_work);
        } else if (rport->port_id == USB2PHY_PORT_HOST)
                cancel_delayed_work_sync(&rport->sm_work);

        return 0;
}

I believe that means any of those work handlers can still be running while
after power_off() -- and therefore can be running after we've disabled the
clock. Might this be your problem?

If so, you're papering that bug by keeping a clock reference in the
controller, which implicitly defers the *actual*
clock_disable_unprepare() until much later.
