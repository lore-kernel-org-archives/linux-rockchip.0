I'm pretty sure that that the above description doesn't quite match the code.

* The above description says that for old hardware there is one clock
and 'clock-names' was not necessary (though as I understand it it's OK
if it's there).

* The old code matched the old description.  AKA: if there was no
"clock-names" then everything was OK.

* The new code will not work if there was no "clock-names".

Many of the old devices had a clock-names present (and it was "pwm"),
but not all.  Specifically it looks like
"arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3xxx.dtsi" doesn't specify a clock-names.

In the above code you need to check the count _before_ trying to get
the clock by name.
