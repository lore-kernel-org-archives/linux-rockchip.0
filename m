From the DT's PoV, this is one entity, which is the IP block.

The clocksource/clockevent concept is a Linux implementation detail. The
DT cannot and should not be aware of that.

Why? A single IP block can provide the functionality of both (though
there are reasons that functionality may be mutually exclusive). What is
the benefit of this split?

Here, you are forcing hackish DT changes that do not truly describe HW.
How is that better?

To me it sounds like what we need is Linux infrastructure that allows
one to register a device as having both clockevent/clocksource
functionality.

That way, we can choose to do something sane at boot time, and if the
user really wants specific devices used in specific ways, they can
request that.

Thanks,
Mark.
