I did not found docs saying mipi_dsi_packet::size is a sum of tx and rx.
tx and rx packets are two different packets, so they do not sum up.
But thanks for bringing it up, it shows docs are incomplete/misleading.

As far as I remember MIPI DSI standard does not allow partial TX, it is
all-or-nothing operation.

mipi_dsi_host_ops::transfer in case of write sends only tx packet, in
case of read it sends tx packets and receives rx packet, so it
can be confusing what it should return in case of read.
IMO changing mipi_dsi_host_ops::transfer to always return number of
bytes RECEIVED or error should make it clearer and simpler.
