Marek,

Sure... a 'policy' decision would be which bootable device to boot
from but the issue I see that needs solving is for the vendor to be
able to describe via dt what devices are bootable for MMC (an SDIO
wifi device is not bootable yet a eMMC/microSD is).

Isn't this exactly the same issue as what the stdout-path specifies in
the chosen node? Modern SoC's have multiple UART's yet boot firmware
needs to know which one is the serial console just like boot firmware
should be able to figure out what device or devices are bootable.

Perhaps we can add a 'bootdev-path' in the chosen node?

Regards,

Tim
