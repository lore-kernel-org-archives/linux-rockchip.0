This patch add the needed clocks into power-controller.

why need we do so that?

Firstly, we always be needed turn off clocks to save power when
the system enter suspend.So we need to enumerate the clocks are needed
to switch power doamin no and off.

Secondly, RK3288 reset circuit should be syncchronous reset and
then sync revoked.so we need to enable clocks of all devices.

Changes in v13:
    - Remove essential clocks from rk3288 PD_VIO domain
    Some clocks are essential for the system health and should not
    be turned down. However there is no owner for them so if they listed
    as belonging to power domain we'll try toggling them up and down
    during power domain.
    - Device drivers expect their devices to be powered on before their
    probing code is invoked. To achieve that we should start with
    power domains powered on (we may turn them off later once all
    devices enable runtime power managment and go idle).
    - This change switches Rockchip power domain driver to use updated
    device_attach and device_detach API.
    - set the gpu/core power domain power delay time.
    - fix enumerating PM clocks for devices.
    - fix use after free
    We can't use clk after we did clk_put(clk).

Changes in v12:
    - Remove essential clocks from rk3288 PD_VIO domain,
    Some clocks are essential for the system health and should
    not be turned down. However there is no owner for them so
    if they listed as belonging to power domain we'll try toggling
    them up and down during power domain transition. As a result we
    either fail to suspend or resume the system.

Changes in v11: None

Changes in v10:
    - fix missing the #include <dt-bindings/power-domain/rk3288.h>
    - remove the notes

Changes in v9:
    - add decription for power-doamin node

Changes in v8:
    - DTS go back to v2

Changes in v7: None
Changes in v6: None
Changes in v5: None
Changes in v4: None

Changes in v3:
    - Decomposition power-controller, changed to multiple controller
    (gpu-power-controller, hevc-power-controller)

Changes in v2:
    - make pd_vio clocks all one entry per line and alphabetize.
    - power: power-controller move back to pinctrl: pinctrl.
