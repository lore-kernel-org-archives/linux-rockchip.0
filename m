But is it really the case here (I don't see any code requesting a
specific pinmux depending on the PWM state)?

Anyway, we really need to handle this case, we should define the
typical voltage when the PWM is disabled. Same as what you suggested
with voltage-when-input, but with a different naming (since the concept
of pinmux is PWM hardware/driver specific).

	voltage-when-pwm-disabled = <...>;
