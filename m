we talked about this beforehand in the Chromeos bug and I verified this in the 
manual for all currently supported Rockchip socs (rk3066 - rk3368), so

Reviewed-by: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>


Background: the original code stems from a time when I was still operating 
without documentation and I took this from the upstream kernel from that time 
and sadly forgot to double check once I had docs.


Thanks for fixing this
Heiko
