With something like the above I'd still expect some complexity
depending on the probe order.  If a less important device grabs the
clock first, it might be forced to re-think its clocks later.  That
might be disconcerting.

OK, so I was just involved in a change recently that made me realize
that maybe our original problems were tied to the fact that our
builtin panels were trying to specify a clock that was impossible to
achieve with CPLL / GPLL.  It was a known problem that the request
would be denied and the CCF would just pick the closest rate it could.
Probably the right thing is to solve _that_ problem first.  If using
simple panel you could do a change like
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/323211/> (though
presumably you'd have to handle people using the same panel in other
laptops).  You might also be able to do funny things to fixup the mode
like dbehr tried to do in
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/270017/>.  By doing this
and making sure that

With that being said, how about this as a solution:

1. Figure some way (presumably some type of device tree property?) to
make sure that the builtin panel chose a clock that was achievable by
dividing CPLL / GPLL on rk3288.  If you have eDP but no builtin panel
you wouldn't specify this and you'd just let the system pick whatever
it wanted.

2. We use "assigned-clocks" to (by default) make NPLL something silly
and unattractive.  This will keep the common clock framework from
picking it to use as the source if the clock could be made just as
well from CPLL / GPLL (or find some other way to make NPLL a lower
priority muxing option).

3. We use the "dibs" rule in that the first display driver to claim
NPLL blocks anyone else from changing things.


In the above on a laptop with a builtin panel and an HDMI port you'd
get the panel using CPLL / GPLL and HDMI getting CPLL, GPLL or NPLL
(and it would be able to change NPLL if needed).


In the above on a dev board with a lot of ports then the first device
probed would get the most flexibility.  Future devices would be
limited in their choices.
