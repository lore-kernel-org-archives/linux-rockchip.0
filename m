The naming convention for the existing Theobroma boards is
soc-q7module-baseboard, so rk3399-puma-haikou and the in-kernel
devicetrees also follow that scheme.

For some reason in the binding a wrong or outdated naming slipped
in which does not match the used devicetrees and makes the dt-schema
complain now.

Fix this by using the names used in the wild by actual boards.
