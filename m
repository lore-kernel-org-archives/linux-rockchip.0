This looks pretty useful and good, though I think these could be two
separate patches. A couple of suggestions on wording and such below.

"created" has the connotation of allocating. Perhaps: "Once the function
returns, you can adjust the ->enabled and ->duty_cycle fields according
to your needs before calling pwm_apply_state()."?

Also note that the field is called ->enabled.

> + * according to your need before calling pwm_apply_state().

Maybe mention that the ->duty_cycle field is explicitly zeroed. Then
again, do we really need it? If users are going to overwrite it anyway,
do we even need to bother? I suppose it makes some sense because the
current duty cycle is stale when the ->period gets set to the value from
args. I think the documentation should mention this in some way.

Perhaps choose a shorter name, such as: pwm_init_state()?

Other kerneldoc comments in this file don't prefix the description with
"the".

Also, perhaps the following descriptions would be slightly less
confusing:

	@state: PWM state to extract the duty cycle from

We don't extract (i.e. return) period from the state, so it's a little
confusing to mention it here.

	@scale: scale in which to return the relative duty cycle

This is slightly more explicit in that it says what the returned duty
cycle will be in. Perhaps as an alternative:

	@scale: target scale of the relative duty cycle

Perhaps: "... into a value relative to the period."?

The example below would give you the duty cycle in percent, not
nanoseconds, right?

"scale in which @duty_cycle is expressed"?

Any reason why we can't call "val" "duty_cycle"? That's what it is,
after all.

Can we return -EINVAL for both of the above checks? I don't like
silently clamping the duty cycle that the user passed in.
