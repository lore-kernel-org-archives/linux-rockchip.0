What if (as implied by the comment) component_match_add() does some ref=
erence counting
of sorts? (I know it doesn't get used only with OF nodes, it is more ge=
neric). I feel
that holding onto a reference to a counted resource without incrementin=
g the use count
is not the right way of doing things, or at least it should be clearly =
documented in
the interface of component_match_add() so that people understand the me=
ss they are
getting into.

See my comment above. Keeping a reference to a resource and passing it
on to other functions (even if they are callbacks) should clearly flag =
the
component framework as one of the refcounters.

Sorry, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that we should keep
the following comment:

			/*
			 * component_match_add keeps a reference to the port
			 * variable.
			 */

How does that explain why we don't drop the reference? Did you mean the=
 comment
should be truncated somewhere else by chance (like including the fact t=
he
reference counting is not done)?

Best regards,
Liviu
