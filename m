This driver really _should not_ become a catchall for settings stuff.
I.e. the jtag/sdmmc switch handles the automatic switching done inside the 
soc based on the card-detect state. Which confuses the dw_mmc driver.

If I'm reading that correctly in the TRM, jtag on Rockchip SoCs is part of 
the coresight infrastructure - in the DAP block.
There are generic drivers + devicetree bindings for (I think most) coresight 
blocks existing now, but I haven't found anything related to the DAP itself.

In theory I'd think real handling of jtag pins/clocks should be done 
somewhere in that area and and if jtag is to be used,it could then be set up 
using in-kernel mechanics, like disabling sdmmc that claims the shared pins 
and enabling the jtag pinctrl and clocks.

This could even be doable at runtime via devicetree overlays.


Most likely way out of scope for now, but that is where I would imagine this 
stuff to be.
