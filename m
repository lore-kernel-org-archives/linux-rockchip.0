So I agree that the above commit was problematic, and that you have
fixed that in your patch ("PM / wakeirq: Convert to SRCU"). But I
noticed there were other threads where people have complained about the
$subject patch also causing problems with drivers that call
disable_irq_nosync() from within an IRQ context. So I poked around with
one such driver that calls disable_irq_nosync() from its ISR [1], and
saw this:

The documentation is fairly suggestive that ->irq_bus_lock() can sleep,
but then it also suggests that disable_irq_nosync() is safe in IRQ
context. So which is the "more true" one?

Brian

[1] Seem familiar? You were complaining about this driver previously.
    At least I didn't point you at an out-of-tree driver, where some of
    the other reports came from :)
