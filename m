Yeah, apologize the delay on giving you a feedback on your code. As I
mentioned before, I had a couple of other things in past weeks that
consumed my time. 

Anyways, this specific patch series looks way better now that you have
split it further. I will have a better look on it again and let you
know when it will land.
